=== WOOCOMMERCE PAYU INDIA GATEWAY ===

By Daniel Dudzic - http://danieldudzic.com/
Based on PayPal Standard Gateway by WooCommerce

PayU India is a gateway plugin that extends WooCommerce, allowing you to take payments via PayU. PayU cooperates with Visa and Mastercard Credit Cards and Debit cards. This means that you easily can take credit card payments as well as direct payments via any of the associated banks.

When the order goes through, the user is taken to PayU to make a secure payment. No SSL certificate is required on your site. After payment the order is confirmed and the user is taken to the thank you page.


== IMPORTANT NOTE ==

In order to use the PayU gateway you need a PayU merchant account. 
Note that the plugin only works if the currency is set to Indian Rupee (â‚¹).
