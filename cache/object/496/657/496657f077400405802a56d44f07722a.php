The company is including a curated collection of <a href="https://elements.envato.com/wordpress/themes/sort-by-latest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">210 WordPress themes</a> and <a href="https://elements.envato.com/wordpress/plugins/sort-by-latest" rel="noopener" target="_blank">100 plugins</a> along with 400,000 other design assets already offered through the service.</p>
<p>Envato is the largest WordPress theme marketplace on the web with 39,102 themes and website templates for sale. Last year the company <a href="https://wptavern.com/envato-celebrates-10-years-in-business" rel="noopener" target="_blank">celebrated 10 years in business</a> and reported that the community earned more than $40 million, with a significant portion of that revenue coming from WordPress products.</p>
<p>The new &#8220;all you can eat&#8221; style package for WordPress themes on Envato Elements was introduced to boost the value of the service&#8217;s annual subscription plan and is not available to monthly subscribers. For $228/year, annual subscribers can change themes as often as they choose, which is the chief selling point of the new addition. However, the subscription service does not provide direct item support for the themes, as they are submitted by independent designers.</p>
<p>Current Elements subscribers have the option to change their payment plans from monthly to annual to gain access to the unlimited WordPress products. Several disgruntled customers have taken to Twitter to express their dissatisfaction with the WordPress additions being withheld from existing monthly subscribers and perceive it to be heavy-handed a tactic for locking in more annual subscribers before raising the price.</p>

<p>An Envato support representative offered some background on the decision in response to monthly subscribers who do not appreciate being excluded from additions to the service.</p>
<p>&#8220;We chose this pricing model because we think it creates the fairest platform for both our subscribers and our authors,&#8221; the representative said. &#8220;A huge amount of time and dedication goes into creating and maintaining WordPress themes and plugin so this allows us to help protect the earnings of the authors who provide our community with premium assets.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 22 Nov 2017 04:01:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a href="https://www.enclavely.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Enclavely, Inc.</a>, the owners of the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tailor Page Builder plugin</a>, have announced that they will be <a href="https://www.tailorwp.com/discontinued/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">discontinuing its development</a> effective immediately.</p>
<p><a href="http://andrewworsfold.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Andrew Worsfold</a>, the original developer, launched Tailor in April 2016 and the plugin received an enthusiastic reception from the WordPress community. After performing <a href="https://wptavern.com/pippin-williamson-shakes-up-page-builder-plugins-with-critical-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a critical review of the major page builders</a> available to users in September 2016, Pippin Williamson found only three that he could happily recommend to his customers: Tailor, Pootle Page Builder, and Beaver Builder. This recommendation was based primarily on code quality, usability, and compatibility with other plugins.</p>
<p>The plugin <a href="https://www.tailorwp.com/tailor-page-builder-under-new-management/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">came under new management in July 2017</a> after the original developer no longer had enough time to dedicate to the project. Worsfold sold it to Enclavely, whose owners were early and enthusiastic users of the plugin, for what he said was &#8220;a nominal amount.&#8221; Three months later, the new owners cite the cost of keeping up with Gutenberg and other competitors as the primary reason for <a href="https://www.tailorwp.com/discontinued/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">discontinuing its development</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gutenberg is going to be bundled with WordPress itself. That’s definitely going to give a tough time to all 3rd party page builders and even that is not the case there are some really big players around like Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, and others which are going to be hard for us to compete with, being a completely free project and providing almost all the great features in free version&#8230;</p>
<p>So the main reason for us to discontinue Tailor is due to finances, which Tailor needs to keep on its development and marketing to compete with all the big players and especially Gutenberg.</p></blockquote>
<p>This instance seems to be more of a case of the new management running out of funds, rather than Gutenberg preemptively killing off a page builder. Enclavely was no longer willing to invest in developing a product that could compete against some of the more widely used page builders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tailor needs a lot of effort and money, which was much more than we estimated,&#8221; an Enclavely representative said when I contacted the company. &#8220;And even if we continue to put effort and money in this project, we all know that Gutenberg is going to smash this space soon and we won&#8217;t be able to survive, and so will be the case with some other page builders. This is why we decided to end this now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tailor currently has more than 3,000 active installations, according to WordPress.org. Fans of the plugin commented on the <a href="https://medium.com/tailor-page-builder/end-of-tailor-rise-of-gutenberg-6b4c59431f99" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a>, asking if the original developer might be able to pick the project back up again.</p>
<p>When I contacted the company, they said the original developer was no longer involved with the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;The original developer has parted ways since the acquisition,&#8221; an Enclavely representative said. &#8220;He was involved with some stuff in the start but not that much, thus the decision is mainly taken by us based on the issues we were facing in maintaining this project.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Worsfold&#8217;s account of his involvement with Tailor following the acquisition differs greatly from Enclavely&#8217;s report.</p>
<p>&#8220;I handed over control of the project in July, although all releases since then were also written by me and deployed on their behalf,&#8221; Worsfold said. &#8220;Given that I haven&#8217;t been asked to help with anything recently, and there have been no further releases, it looks like development has already ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>The plugin is <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/tailor/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">available free on WordPress.org</a> and licensed under the GPL, so anyone who wants to can fork it. Worsfold doesn&#8217;t anticipate having the time to maintain the project himself and said he was under the impression that Enclavely is attempting to sell it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I made the decision to hand over control of Tailor as work and other commitments meant that I couldn&#8217;t dedicate enough time to the project,&#8221; Worsfold said. &#8220;I had hoped that the new team would continue development, provide support, and ensure the needs of existing users were met. However after just three months they&#8217;ve decided to give up. That&#8217;s obviously very disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worsfold said that when he sold it to them, it was with the understanding that they would continue to develop and maintain it. He doesn&#8217;t anticipate being able to re-adopt it due to a lack of time to dedicate to the project.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in much the same situation I was in before and it seems they are wanting to on-sell it themselves, so I can&#8217;t imagine I will be able to readopt it,&#8221; Worsfold said. &#8220;I have mixed feelings about the whole situation. Ultimately I see Gutenberg doing most of what page builders currently do, but in a better, more standardized, way. Hopefully, whatever&#8217;s left (custom blocks, styles, functionality etc.) will build on the framework and serve to reduce the amount of fragmentation in the ecosystem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Worsfold is still limited on free time but said he would be willing to contribute to the project  if someone decided to fork it and keep it alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be a shame to see something I built, and that people use, simply die,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Hopefully someone will either fork it or take over development.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Nov 2017 00:15:40 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Last month <a href="https://wptavern.com/github-launches-new-dependency-graph-feature-with-security-alerts-coming-soon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub launched its Dependency Graph feature</a> that tracks a repository&#8217;s dependencies and sub-dependencies under the Insights tab.

<p>Dependency graphs and security alerts are automatically enabled for public repositories, provided the repository owner has defined the dependencies in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/listing-the-packages-that-a-repository-depends-on" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of the supported manifest file types</a>, such as package.json or Gemfile.

Vulnerability detection is currently limited to JavaScript and Ruby projects but Python support is next on the roadmap for 2018.

<p>The 2017 event received a total of 235 speaker applications and 43 were selected for the main event. Organizers plan to stick to the same format and are calling for 40-minute talks (30 min + 10 min Q&amp;A) as well as 10-minute lightning talks. This year the event will experiment with hosting community workshops and organizers plan to open a separate call for workshop leaders next week.</p>
<p>The Content Team put out a specific call for more technical talks at the 2018 event after a <a href="https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/11/10/how-your-feedback-will-help-us-shape-the-next-wordcamp-europe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">community survey</a> showed that more developer-oriented talks are what the audience is looking for.

<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-17-at-11.44.21-AM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The survey also showed that 37% of respondents have been working with WordPress for more than 9 years and roughly 90% of attendees have been using WordPress for 4-9+ years. Advanced development was the most highly requested topic for presentations, selected by 53% of respondents, followed by design (45%).</p>

<p>The survey results offer some insight about which topics might fare well at WCEU in 2018. Organizers have also compiled an extensive <a href="https://apply.wp-europe.org/ideas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list of ideas and topics</a> to inspire speaker applicants.</p>
<p>A batch of 1,000 Early Bird tickets recently <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2018-early-bird-tickets-now-on-sale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">went on sale</a> and there are still 680 available. Attendees who purchase a ticket before December 31, 2017, will receive a limited-edition swag item. The organizing team plans to release tickets in batches, as in previous years, but will not be setting specific expectations on sales this year, according to PR representative Letizia Barbi. The Sava Center venue, an international congress and cultural center, is the largest audience hall in Serbia and will accommodate all who want to attend WCEU 2018. Barbi said it should also scale down nicely in case of a smaller turn out.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 19:19:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Nearly every WordPress theme and plugin developer will be impacted by the change and many are starting to look ahead to how their products may interact with Gutenberg in the future.</p>
<p>What will e-commerce look like in the Gutenberg era? The WooCommerce design team has published <a href="https://woocommerce.com/2017/11/woocommerce-gutenberg/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a preview of some of their &#8220;Wootenberg&#8221; experiments</a>, along with a gif demonstrating what a block-based editing experience may look like in the context of working with products. The team sees a lot of potential for putting the power of visual product editing into the hands of users.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wootenberg.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The example shows a quick exploration of page layout with product blocks and the team also posted an idea of what basic product authoring may look like with a predefined product template that includes the featured image, product title, description, and price as new Gutenberg blocks. But will it be possible to have complex product creation fit into a block-based editor? The WooCommerce team admits in the post that they don&#8217;t yet know how this will work.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that isn’t yet 100% clear is how complex plugins like WooCommerce will work with Gutenberg,&#8221; Automattic designer/developer James Koster said. &#8220;A simple product with a description, a price, and a category is one thing. But a product with variations, for each of which you want to upload a different image, and need to manage/track stock is quite another. Imagining a WYSIWYG editing experience for that kind of data is a little fuzzier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Koster referenced Gutenberg&#8217;s newly merged support for meta boxes, the first step in making product authoring possible. However, the Gutenberg team is still experimenting and isn&#8217;t yet set on a solution for implementing meta boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;How this works with WooCommerce in the long term is unclear,&#8221; Koster said. &#8220;But you can rest assured it’s something we’ll be dedicating more time to investigating as WordPress approaches the 5.0 release.&#8221; Koster concludes the post by asking readers if visual product editing, with the flexibility to rearrange product/shop layouts, is something that interests them.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there’s one thing that WooCommerce should perhaps learn from Shopify’s rapid growth, it’s that many &#8216;would-be&#8217; shop owners don’t care to spend hours upon hours tweaking the layout of their shop, and that pre-built easy-to-use software that looks good and feels good, but can still be extended in complex ways, is what attracts many users,&#8221; Jesse Nickles commented on the post. &#8220;While this may be the underlying goal of Gutenberg, it perhaps doesn’t crossover clearly to the e-commerce world.&#8221;</p>
<p>Koster said he agrees that users don&#8217;t always need visual editing experiences and that simple things like price changes should be quick and painless.</p>
<p>&#8220;How we present data-driven editing alongside the Gutenberg experience will ultimately determine the success of the project from a WooCommerce perspective,&#8221; Koster said.</p>
<p>Support for meta boxes is one the most challenging aspects of the Gutenberg project that the team has yet to solve. Exploring the possibilities of flexible page layouts for products is exciting, but even the WooCommerce team is left wondering how this is all going to work with more complex CMS data. Smaller product teams without the collective knowledge and resources of WooCommerce may have a more difficult time finding the bandwidth to experiment and rebuild their products in time for WordPress 5.0.</p>
<p>The WooCommerce team invites any users interested in Gutenberg-related UX changes to join the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://woocommerce.com/design-feedback/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">design feedback group</a>, as they continue to explore how the new editor will work in the context of complex e-commerce product creation and display.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Nov 2017 04:30:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Community feedback on the new <a href="https://www.gdprwp.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GDPR for WordPress project</a>, created by WordCamp Denmark organizer Kåre Mulvad Steffensen and WP Pusher creator Peter Suhm, has started rolling in after the two launched a survey for developers. The project aims to provide an industry standard for getting plugins compliant with EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation ahead of the May 2018 deadline.</p>
<p>Steffensen <a href="https://www.gdprwp.com/status-the-gdpr-interface/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">published</a> some initial results of the survey after having it open for two weeks. So far, 90% of respondents have answered that they would consider implementing a GDPR &#8220;file&#8221; types solution for their plugins if a standard was available. Only 4.9% of the 40 developers who responded said they have a plan for making their plugins GDPR compliant and 43.9% said they do not currently have a plan. The remaining 24.4% were developers of plugins that do not handle personal data.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our talks with Paul Sieminski from <a href="https://automattic.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Automattic</a> and Dovy Paukstys from the <a href="https://reduxframework.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Redux options framework</a> have reassured us that we still do have a need for a GDPR structure which can help the community establish a basis for handling GDPR compliance,&#8221; Steffensen said.</p>
<p>Steffensen and Suhm created a <a href="https://github.com/GDPRWP/standard" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> where they have outlined their proposal for a PHP object interface that plugin developers could add to their codebases as a standard way of indicating how their plugins work with personal data.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nature of such an interface puts some responsibility in the hands of the developer to identify any place personal data is stored,&#8221; Steffensen said. &#8220;What kind of data it is, and for what purpose as well as how it should be handled upon deletion. The Interface approach will allow a community-wide adoption, without setting limitations on how plugin developers choose to work with their data – something we obviously can’t control.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea is that plugin developers could then build other tools on top of this framework using specific functions that correspond to GDPR requirements, such as functions that allow users to access their data, implement the right to be forgotten, report data breaches, and delete and anonymize data. Developers could also build plugins that offer a plain language description of what personal data a plugin collects and how it is handled.</p>
<p>In speaking with Dovy Paukstys on how this could work with Redux, Steffensen said the options framework may be able to facilitate compliance for the 500,000+ sites where it is active and the developers who use it to build plugins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dovy from Redux has a coder&#8217;s view on this,&#8221; Steffensen said. &#8220;Our object interface (PHP) would be something his framework could provide an easy way to utilize for the many developers using Redux.  The redux users (developers) could essentially do this themselves also, but since Redux is a framework it makes sense to see if they can build something that will make it near instant for developers to provide compliance for the GDPR.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steffensen said the team is aware that the first version of the interface will not render plugins, and by extension their sites, instantly compliant. The interface they are proposing is not one that could be held legally accountable, but the goal is to make it possible for developers to build accountable systems on top of it.</p>
<h3>GDPR for WordPress Project Founders Consider Accepting Sponsorships</h3>
<p>With 189 <a href="http://www.gdprcountdownclock.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">days remaining before the GDPR goes into effect</a>, the team will need to work quickly to make a solution available with enough time for interested developers to incorporate it into their plugins. They have not yet set up a way to accept donations but are considering it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t actively seeking funding, but would love any funds that would help us allocate the time needed to keep the momentum going,&#8221; Steffensen said. &#8220;We&#8217;re lucky that the <a href="https://wptavern.com/gdpr-for-wordpress-project-seeks-to-provide-a-standard-for-plugin-compliance" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WP Tavern article</a> brought attention to our GDPR approach and have caught the eyes of some of the key players in the ecosystem. One such company is Mailpoet that was the first to raise the idea of sponsoring our work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steffensen works at <a href="http://Peytz.dk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Peytz.dk</a>, a Danish WordPress agency that wants to support the community and has allocated some of his time to work on the project. He said any funding/donations they receive would be spent on pushing the roadmap forward, investing time in coding, and possibly seeking further advice from people who they cannot expect to be in it for free.</p>
<p>In addition to looking at ways to receive donations, the team plans to keep the survey open for developers for awhile longer to try to make more connections in the community. Steffensen said they hope respondents will help them gain insight on the developer community&#8217;s readiness and also enable them to reach out to any plugin owners who could play a key role in a wider adoption.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 20:58:22 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

This update introduces major improvements to the design and collaboration workflow in the Customizer, improves WordPress&#8217; built-in code editor, and enhances core text and media widgets.</p>
<h4>Draft, Schedule, and Preview Changes in the Customizer</h4>
<p>Prior to 4.9, users could get a live preview of their sites in the Customizer but any changes they made would need to be saved immediately or discarded. This update makes it possible to draft and schedule changes in the Customizer, and even share a preview link to collaborate on changes before making them live. Users can now stage content, such as new pages, a new set of widgets, a different combination of menu items, and schedule it all to publish at a future date.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/customizer-publish-settings-schedule-e1510636315310.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>This release also brings the ability to search, browse, and preview themes directly in the Customizer. The search interface includes filters for subject, features, and layout, just like the ones on the &#8220;Add Themes&#8221; screen in wp-admin. It does not yet include the featured, popular, latest, or favorites tabs, so users will need to navigate back to the admin if they want to browse those categories.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/theme-browser-customizer.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The menu creation process has also been updated in the Customizer to be less confusing with a rethink of the UI and revised copy.</p>
<h4>Syntax Highlighting and Error Checking Added to the Code Editors</h4>
<p>WordPress 4.9 brings syntax highlighting, linting, and auto-completion to the built-in code editors by incorporating the <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> library. These long-awaited improvements are now available in the theme and plugin editors as well as the custom HTML widget and additional CSS box in the Customizer. The feature comes with <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-protects-users-from-fatal-errors-created-in-the-theme-and-plugin-editors" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prominent warnings</a> about directly editing themes and plugins and protection against saving code that would cause a fatal error.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/editor-css-error-e1510640427941.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<h4>New Core Gallery Widget and Support for Shortcodes and Embedded Media in the Text Widget</h4>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/core-gallery-widget.png?ssl=1"><img /></a><a href="https://wptavern.com/new-core-gallery-widget-targeted-for-wordpress-4-9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordPress 4.9 adds a new gallery widget</a> to the collection of core media widgets (audio, image, and video) that were introduced in 4.8. It brings the same gallery-creation features to widgets that have long been available in the post and page editors.</p>
<p>These incremental changes will help users get ready for Gutenberg&#8217;s block-based interface. The plan is to eventually transition widgets over to blocks after Gutenberg is in core and the plugin already has support for a gallery block, as well as a Custom HTML block.</p>
<p>As of 4.9, users can now embed media in the Text widget, including images, video, and audio by clicking the &#8220;Add Media&#8221; button. In order to make this possible, WordPress contributors also needed to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-will-support-shortcodes-and-embedded-media-in-the-text-widget" rel="noopener" target="_blank">add shortcode support to widgets</a>, a feature that users have requested for nearly a decade. With this now built into core, hundreds of thousands of WordPress sites will no longer need additional code from plugins and themes to use shortcodes in widgets.</p>
<p>Widgets have also been improved to offer a better migration experience with updated logic for mapping widgets between two themes’ widget areas.</p>
<h4>On Towards Gutenberg</h4>
<p>WordPress 4.9 also includes a notice in the about.php page of the admin, inviting users to help test or contribute to Gutenberg. It is the first time a feature plugin has been highlighted so prominently on the page users see after they update to the latest version.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-4.33.01-PM-e1510785254925.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The Gutenberg project has been getting a lot of attention over the past few months as the WordPress community looks ahead to the 5.0 release that will introduce the new editor to the world. Meanwhile, contributors to 4.9 have been working in tandem to make significant improvements to existing features, enabling users to do more with widgets and overall site design than ever before. This release was led by Weston Ruter and Mel Choyce with help from 443 contributors, 42% (185) of them contributing to WordPress for the first time.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 16 Nov 2017 01:24:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/banner.png?fit=2400%2C1200&ssl=1" alt="" />
<p>Version 4.9 of WordPress, named “Tipton” in honor of jazz musician and band leader Billy Tipton, is available for download or update in your WordPress dashboard. New features in 4.9 will smooth your design workflow and keep you safe from coding errors.</p>
<p>Featuring design drafts, scheduling, and locking, along with preview links, the Customizer workflow improves collaboration for content creators. What’s more, code syntax highlighting and error checking will make for a clean and smooth site building experience. Finally, if all that wasn’t pretty great, we’ve got an awesome new Gallery widget and improvements to theme browsing and switching.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2>Customizer Workflow Improved </h2>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/customizer-workflow-improved-small.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="" />
<h3>Draft and Schedule Site Design Customizations</h3>
<p>Yes, you read that right. Just like you can draft and revise posts and schedule them to go live on the date and time you choose, you can now tinker with your site’s design and schedule those design changes to go live as you please.</p>
<h3>Collaborate with Design Preview Links</h3>
<p>Need to get some feedback on proposed site design changes? WordPress 4.9 gives you a preview link you can send to colleagues and customers so that you can collect and integrate feedback before you schedule the changes to go live. Can we say collaboration++?</p>
<h3>Design Locking Guards Your Changes</h3>
<p>Ever encounter a scenario where two designers walk into a project and designer A overrides designer B’s beautiful changes? WordPress 4.9’s design lock feature (similar to post locking) secures your draft design so that no one can make changes to it or erase all your hard work.</p>
<h3>A Prompt to Protect Your Work</h3>
<p>Were you lured away from your desk before you saved your new draft design? Fear not, when you return, WordPress 4.9 will politely ask whether or not you’d like to save your unsaved changes.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2>Coding Enhancements</h2>
<img src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/coding-enhancements-small.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="" />
<h3>Syntax Highlighting and Error Checking? Yes, Please!</h3>
<p>You’ve got a display problem but can’t quite figure out exactly what went wrong in the CSS you lovingly wrote. With syntax highlighting and error checking for CSS editing and the Custom HTML widget introduced in WordPress 4.8.1, you’ll pinpoint coding errors quickly. Practically guaranteed to help you scan code more easily, and suss out &amp; fix code errors quickly.</p>
<h3>Sandbox for Safety</h3>
<p>The dreaded white screen. You’ll avoid it when working on themes and plugin code because WordPress 4.9 will warn you about saving an error. You’ll sleep better at night.</p>
<h3>Warning: Potential Danger Ahead!</h3>
<p>When you edit themes and plugins directly, WordPress 4.9 will politely warn you that this is a dangerous practice and will recommend that you draft and test changes before updating your file. Take the safe route: You’ll thank you. Your team and customers will thank you.</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2>Even More Widget Updates </h2>
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/even-more-widget-updates-small.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="" />
<h3>The New Gallery Widget</h3>
<p>An incremental improvement to the media changes hatched in WordPress 4.8, you can now add a gallery via this new widget. Yes!</p>
<h3>Press a Button, Add Media</h3>
<p>Want to add media to your text widget? Embed images, video, and audio directly into the widget along with your text, with our simple but useful Add Media button. Woo!</p>
<hr class="wp-block-separator" />
<h2>Site Building Improvements </h2>
<img src="https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/11/site-building-improvements-small.png?w=632&ssl=1" alt="" />
<h3>More Reliable Theme Switching</h3>
<p>When you switch themes, widgets sometimes think they can just move location. Improvements in WordPress 4.9 offer more persistent menu and widget placement when you decide it’s time for a new theme. </p>
<h3>Find and Preview the Perfect Theme</h3>
<p>Looking for a new theme for your site? Now, from within the Customizer, you can search, browse, and preview over 2600 themes before deploying changes to your site. What’s more, you can speed your search with filters for subject, features, and layout.</p>
<h3>Better Menu Instructions = Less Confusion</h3>
<p>Were you confused by the steps to create a new menu? Perhaps no longer! We’ve ironed out the UX for a smoother menu creation process. Newly updated copy will guide you.</p>

<p>Last week contributors began exploring <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-alternative-to-using-iframes-for-meta-boxes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an alternative to using iframes for meta boxes</a>. This experiment has landed in 1.7 so that the plugin now <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">renders meta boxes inline</a>. Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella, who wrote and merged the code, said that it doesn&#8217;t fix all the meta box issues and might create some new ones, but it &#8220;gets us closer to where we want to go.&#8221; Pre-rendering meta boxes and creating a migration path for existing ones is next on the agenda.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting new features in 1.7 is the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3357" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-block transform functionality</a> that allows users to select multiple blocks and instantly transform them into other block types. It works like a little bit of Gutenberg magic. By default, users can select multiple paragraphs and transform them into a list or select multiple images and transform them into a gallery.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-2.50.25-PM-e1510779367673.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>After selecting two or more blocks, the user can click on the block&#8217;s settings in the toolbar to transform them. They can also be easily changed back to single blocks. The multi-block transform functionality has been added to the Blocks API so that developers can set isMultiBlock to true to specify blocks that can be transformed.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-3.31.49-PM-e1510781927286.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>Version 1.7 introduces a new toggle that the team is testing for <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3311" rel="noopener" target="_blank">switching between the top fixed toolbar and the contextual toolbars attached to each block</a>. It provides an easy way for users to test both types of toolbar styles, but may be temporary as the pull request was submitted as a suggestion for an A/B test.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-15-at-4.03.38-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>Gutenberg 1.7 <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2743" rel="noopener" target="_blank">paves the way for nested blocks</a> in the data structure. It also adds <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3318" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hooks for block extensibility</a> and contributors are currently testing how these work internally.</p>
<p>A few other notable features in this release include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2896" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@-mention autocomplete for users</a> in a site</li>
<li>Allow <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2792" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pasting standalone images</a> and uploading them (also supports pasting base64 encoded images)</li>
<li>Full <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3401" rel="noopener" target="_blank">design update to focus styles</a> around the UI</li>
<li>Placed <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3459" rel="noopener" target="_blank">&#8220;table of contents&#8221; button in the header area</a>, disabled when there are no blocks in the content, added paragraph count</li>
</ul>
<p>Gutenberg&#8217;s documentation has also been <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3381" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moved</a> to <a href="https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/</a>, signaling the project is getting closer to becoming part of WordPress. The new editor will be included in WordPress 5.0, which will ship when Gutenberg is ready. A notice in the 4.9 about.php page invites users to start testing the feature plugin ahead of its inclusion in core.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 15 Nov 2017 23:57:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Then I discovered Geocities, which at the time made it easy to break and fix code and have it instantly live for others to find on the world wide web. It was an optimal learning environment for me. I learned HTML and CSS by copying, pasting, and then tweaking every which way until it was doing something absurd like flashing hot pink text. It was the Wild West and there were no real rules yet except for those in this new language.</p>
<blockquote><p>Like any language, I was learning little by little in search of ways to bend the rules and “speak” like a native.</p></blockquote>
<p>I only coded for fun, but many years later, I made a website for a job. I used Dreamweaver because I was told all professionals used Dreamweaver. I found it easy to use, much easier than Frontpage, especially for building a larger more complex website. I started learning how to read PHP and doing a lot of what was needed in the metadata and the code for basic SEO.</p>
<h3>Finding WordPress</h3>
<p>Fast forward another few years. I set up several free sites for nonprofits using Webs, Weebly, other page builders whose names I can’t recall, Joomla, and then, one day I stumbled upon WordPress. I wasn’t sure if I liked it at first because the out of the box theme was ugly and I couldn’t figure out how to manipulate it. Then, I found a theme on Themeforest that installed the styles and the demo content. This was worth the $30. This gave me the ability to tweak the theme because I knew enough HTML and CSS to change things in the file editor. I was still coding like I did in my Geocities days, only my aesthetics had improved.</p>
<p>I cringe relaying that experience now. I knew enough to be really dangerous. I didn’t do any form of version control, I didn’t do any backups, I didn’t vet my plugins, or even know how to properly vet my plugins.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am so lucky nothing went terribly wrong.</p></blockquote>
<p>On one hand, WordPress gave me an easy way to dive right in and do everything on my own. On the other hand, it made it too easy for me to download bad plugins, edit things I probably should not have been touching, and in the end, I guess that’s okay because when I was serious about maintaining a website, I did take the time to learn more about what I needed to know.</p>
<h3>Finding What I Needed</h3>
<p>What I know today is that I am not a developer. I’m not even a designer. I have fun with the creation process, but there are other people who are much more talented and efficient in those processes and I’m happy to pay them for their expertise. I have learned what I need to know about the framework and can talk to designers and developers about what I’m looking for and ensure they know what they’re doing. I can pick out reliable themes and plugins. I can advise our clients, who are mostly nonprofits and social enterprises, on the best path for a sustainable website. I understand the need for disaster recovery, backups, and security. I understand the value of paid premium licenses and ongoing support.</p>
<p>These are all things that in my days of starting out I didn’t know I needed. Even if someone tried to explain it to me, I probably wouldn’t have felt that I needed them. Sometimes I can be stubborn and I need to experience the pain points myself before I buy into what everyone else is saying. I used to learn best from failure.</p>
<blockquote><p>I still learn from failure, but when it comes to WordPress, I have also surrounded myself with a community who help me grow and learn.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2013, I started attending the Fort Worth WordPress meetup. The group was still pretty small at the time, but they were very inviting. I picked up some new tips and tricks that I used right away. While my eyes glazed over at some of the more advanced details, I understood the possibilities and that the work was beyond my capabilities. I learned how to ask for help with those things. Remember, I’m not a designer or a developer, so this meant hiring for those skills from the network of people I met in the WordPress community.</p>
<p>Over the last 4 ½ years I’ve been able to sell numerous WordPress projects and some of them are incredibly custom and complex. In return, I’ve been able to provide freelance work for members of my community; I’ve been able to give back via WordCamps sharing my experience with project scoping, sales, and negotiations. We all have something of value to share. No matter your area of expertise, you can give something back to the community.</p>
<h3>The Real Value</h3>
<p>The best thing about WordPress is not the tool itself. It’s the people who use it or are wanting to try it. The WordPress community is what makes WordPress and WordCamps really great. My hope is that as a community we can help WordPress evolve and adapt and that we can leverage technology, including WordPress, for the greater good.</p>
<p>We’ve already done this and that’s why WordPress powers almost 30% of the web. We’ve been doing it for years, but the technology landscape is changing rapidly. Are we keeping up?</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Chris Lema asked me and a group of other WordPressers, “What could destroy WordPress, and how would you fix it?” We answered this a number of ways and you’ve probably come up with your own answer. My answer? I think that the evolution of technology could destroy WordPress.</p>
<p>To fix that we would need to evolve, dream big, and create the innovative changes that would keep WordPress alive. We can’t wait until the changes are already in place. It would take far too long for such a large ecosystem to catch up, and in the meantime, it would start to disappear. Look at Kodak; my kids don’t even know what a Kodak moment is. That’s just sad.</p>
<h3>What is our dream as a community?</h3>
<p>Will people talk about WordPress in the past tense or will we find ways to help it thrive?</p>
<p>Even as we work towards the same dream, there are still complex challenges to overcome. We’ll likely fail many times as we try to innovate. This is actually good; we’ll learn from those mistakes, but we might become jaded. We’ll certainly have moments of frustration. We might even try another framework, and the grass might actually be greener on the other side. Yet, the fact that we are such a close knit community sets us apart.</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine what could happen if a community this large banded together towards one dream.</p></blockquote>
<p>We could pave a path towards something really great. It feels like a huge undertaking. It’s something that could paralyze us if we tried to get it “right” before we started. The key is to set common goals, but to individually start working and living on purpose. Then, we can come together in a more meaningful way.</p>
<p>In my recent keynote at WordCamp DFW I shared a bit of my heritage and my life story so that people could understand my passion for social impact. Everyone has a story that makes them a unique fit to tackle different challenges. When we put our collective skills together, we can make a difference.</p>

<p>A release candidate (RC) means we think we’re done, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible we’ve missed something. In fact, we did miss some things in RC1 and RC2. This third release candidate was not originally scheduled, but due a number of defects uncovered through your testing of RC2 (thank you!), we are putting out another 4.9 release candidate.</p>
<p>We hope to ship WordPress 4.9 on <strong>Tuesday, November 14</strong> (that&#8217;s <em>tomorrow</em>) at 23:00 UTC, but we still need your help to get there. If you haven’t tested 4.9 yet, now is the time! If there are additional defects uncovered through testing between now and the release time, we may delay the 4.9 release to the following day.</p>
<p>To test WordPress 4.9, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin or you can <a href="https://wordpress.org/wordpress-4.9-RC3.zip">download the release candidate here</a> (zip).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve made <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/log/branches/4.9?action=stop_on_copy&mode=stop_on_copy&rev=42178&stop_rev=42133">just over 20 changes</a> since releasing RC2 last week (as we did between RC1 and RC2).

A few specific areas to test in RC3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switching between the Visual and Text tabs of the editor, and the syncing of the cursor between those two tabs.</li>
<li>Overriding linting errors in the Customizer&#8217;s Additional CSS editor.</li>
<li>Adding nav menu items for Custom Links in the Customizer.</li>
<li>Scheduling customization drafts (stubbed posts/pages) for publishing in the Customizer.</li>
<li>Autosave revisions for changes in the Customizer.</li>
<li>About page styling.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Developers</strong>, please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 4.9 and update your plugin’s <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 4.9.

<p><a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/95-keyboard-ia-writer-5/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">iA Writer 5 for iOS</a> was released last week, nearly a year after <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/ia-writer-4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">version 4</a>. This update is free for those who purchased version 4 from the iOS App Store. iA Writer 5 for Mac is still in the works. The free Android version of the app is receiving incremental improvements that will bring it to parity with version 5 in the near future.</p>
<p>iA Writer is a plain text writing and editing app that is popular with authors, academics, and long-form writers. It&#8217;s also a favorite among WordPress users who look to third-party apps for to provide a more focused, distraction-free writing environment. In April 2016, version 3.1.4 for Mac and iOS introduced publishing drafts to WordPress.com and Jetpack-powered sites.</p>
<p>Version 5 focuses on making everything accessible through the keyboard by bringing the Open Quickly feature in iA Writer for Mac to iOS. The app&#8217;s creators said the goal of the design process was to &#8220;allow the writer to do everything without leaving the keyboard, including file handling, export, and all commands.&#8221; The new Quick Search feature is now built into the keyboard bar along with with a fully configurable keyboard. This allows users to quickly do things like create new files, switch to night mode, and export to PDF without leaving the keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-12-at-11.20.56-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>This release adds new organization features that allow users to select multiple files and folders and move, rename, or delete them from the Library. It also introduces Smart Folders which can be created based on a set of rules. Version 5 <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/files-in-ios11/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adds support for iOS11’s Files system</a>, allowing users to open and edit text files from any storage provider that works with Files. Support for Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box is already available with more providers coming soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-13-at-12.54.33-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The makers of iA Writer are interested in <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/ia-writer-5-forging-the-hammer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exploring other platforms</a> if there is sufficient interest, including the possibility of creating a Windows version. Demand doesn&#8217;t seem to be very high, as the writing app&#8217;s fans are primarily Apple-only users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">How badly do you want a Windows version of iA Writer?</p>
<p>&mdash; iA Writer (@iAWriter) <a href="https://twitter.com/iAWriter/status/920297492280852480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, users across multiple platforms have requested a web version of iA Writer, and the company confirmed in September that they are already working on it. After releasing a big Material Design <a href="https://ia.net/writer/blog/turbocharged-ia-writer-for-android/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">update to the iA for Android app </a>in October, the creators said Android users will be the first to have access to the web version:</p>
<blockquote><p>The biggest request from you was collaboration, in other words, iA Writer for Web. iA Writer for Android will stay free and you will be able to connect and subscribe to the Web version via the app, if you wish to. If you could tell us what you’d expect to pay for it, that would be very helpful&#8230;As part of our commitment to continually improve iA Writer on all platforms, Android will likely be the first to gain access to the upcoming Web collaboration.</p></blockquote>
<p>The upcoming web version should provide a sort of bridge for users on other desktop platforms without an iA Writer app.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no target release date for iA Writer 5 for Mac but iA Inc has <a href="https://twitter.com/iA/status/917679399008215041" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that it will also be a free update for those who have purchased the previous version.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 13 Nov 2017 22:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Two weeks ago, the author of WP-SPamShield and the author of the Plugin Organizer plugin exchanged contentious remarks in a <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/please-remove-code-that-maliciously-disables-wp-spamshield/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">support forum thread</a> where each accused the other of targeting each others&#8217; plugins.

<blockquote><p>Sorry, I thought it was clear that it’s issues regarding the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/guidelines/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forum guidelines</a> and rule #9:<br />
 <em>Intentionally attempting to exploit loopholes in the guidelines</em>.</p>
<p>To whit, you were asked to make a change and did so incompletely. If this was not intentional, then I apologize.</p>
<p>I’ve sent you a followup email, trying to clarify what we would accept as solutions to the issue (I came up with 3 options, but I’m open to hearing more).</p>
<p>I understand why you’re angry and we will respect any decision you make regarding this. Nothing that has happened thus far is insurmountable or permanent.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the post Allen published, he said his experiences with the Plugin Team over the past 10 years have caused him to decide to move his plugins off of WordPress.org. When I contacted him to see if he plans to update his code according to the Plugin Team&#8217;s suggestions, he said he doesn&#8217;t agree with the solutions the team is offering, nor their assessment of the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They really were not solutions,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;It was just rehashing the same issues we&#8217;d already discussed. Unfortunately, neither Otto nor Mika have the security expertise to be making the dictates they were making, so there were no realistic solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Allen also claimed that Epstein&#8217;s report about him making a change and it being incomplete was not accurate and that the Plugin Team did not seem to be on the same page:</p>
<blockquote><p>We literally did exactly what they asked and made the changes. Two weeks ago Mika had emailed me and indicated things were good. (No code updates since then.) Then two weeks of silence, and then angry email from Otto out of the blue yesterday telling us it was booted. The issue he brought up was different code.</p>
<p>The two of them cannot make up their minds on what is acceptable, and what is not. The arbitrary removal was the last straw though. WordPress.org is the only venue that would do that. We repeatedly asked them what rule we broke, to no answer. Only after I called Mika out on the forum did she come up with something &#8211; Rule 9 &#8211; exploiting a loophole in the rules. Seriously? It&#8217;s impossible for developers to comply with rules that are constantly changing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Allen confirmed that his team at Red Sand Media Group plans to pull all seven of its plugins from WordPress.org as the result of the incident but will continue maintaining and hosting them elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers cannot operate like that,&#8221; Allen said. &#8220;People depend on us. While it might hurt a bit in the short term, in the long term, we have to do it. There really need to be some major reforms to the way plugins are handled.&#8221;</p>
<p>WP-SpamShield was installed on more than 100,000 WordPress sites before it was removed. There is currently no standard way to notify users why a plugin was removed from the directory, but the original dispute between the WP-SpamShield and Plugin Organizer authors is public, as well as a few exchanges between Allen and the Plugin Team. Allen said he is still working out the details of how to notify users that his plugins will be hosted elsewhere from now on.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll come up with a good plan in the next few days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some people have been notified already because WordFence let them know yesterday that WPSS was removed. (They knew before I did.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Samuel &#8220;Otto&#8221; Wood said the Plugin Team is still willing to put Allen&#8217;s plugins back up if he removes the code in question and that the team is not offended by a plugin developer being angry over a decision. At this time Allen appears to be unwilling to comply with the team&#8217;s most recent requests.</p>
<p>In the meantime, users who know that WP-SpamShield was been removed are waiting to hear if they need to begin looking for a replacement. Allen said that users shouldn&#8217;t need to replace the plugin, since the it will continue to work as before. However, some users are not comfortable installing free plugins hosted outside of WordPress.org. Allen&#8217;s team is figuring out a plan for how they will deliver updates to the plugin and will post more information for users on the <a href="https://www.redsandmarketing.com/blog/wp-spamshield-removed-wordpress-org-directory-without-cause/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Red Sand Marketing blog</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 11 Nov 2017 04:19:08 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The company received <a href="https://wptavern.com/weglot-multilingual-plugin-closes-450k-in-seed-funding" rel="noopener" target="_blank">€450K in seed funding</a> in May 2017 and has nearly doubled its user base in the past six months. Co-founder Rémy Berda reports that the plugin is approaching 20,000 users and that more than 20,000 websites are connected to the Weglot API, if you include the company&#8217;s Shopify product and those using the JS script directly.</p>
<p>WordPress customers currently represent 75% of Weglot&#8217;s revenue with Shopify at 25%, but Berda says the two markets are growing at the same rate. In May, the company&#8217;s customer distribution was primarily in the US and France, which made sense as the product&#8217;s founders are French and Weglot was first marketed to the French WordPress community. Weglot&#8217;s customer distribution has become more global over the past six months and the US has now overtaken France as the strongest market for the multilingual plugin. Canada has also passed Germany, and Berda said he thinks the distribution will eventually align progressively with global WordPress usage.</p>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/chart-1.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Weglot customer distribution as of November 2017
<p>Despite having only recently entered the WordPress community in a niche with well-established competitors, Weglot&#8217;s cofounders are confident their SaaS approach is the road to success for becoming the best multilingual solution for WordPress. The team is aiming for its product to become the highest rated multilingual plugin in the WordPress directory within the next six months.</p>
<p><a href="https://wpml.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WPML</a>, a purely commercial product and the most widely used, has been in business since 2009 and is active on more than 500K sites. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Polylang</a>, a popular free plugin with a commercial option, is installed on more than 300,000 sites and has a 4.7-star rating on WordPress.org. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate-x/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">qTranslate X</a> is also a formidable competitor with more than 100,000 active installs and a 4.7-star rating.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now the two biggest plugins in terms of active installs are WPML and Polylang,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;Both don&#8217;t have a SaaS approach. Polylang recently released the PRO version (it was only free previously) but it is still sold as a piece of software, not a SaaS. We are convinced that SaaS is the right approach as it allows us to be in constant relation with users and make the product evolve faster. It&#8217;s also healthier in terms of business.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although he has no precise statistics on how many, Berda said he sees a lot of former WPML and Polylang users (freelancers and agencies) in their support center who have opted to use Weglot on their new projects. This indicates that Weglot may not so much be whittling away at the existing customer base of other plugins but is finding success at attracting customers who are starting new projects.</p>
<p>In their efforts to stake a claim in the WordPress ecosystem, the Weglot team has found that being active in the community is important to having a successful product.</p>
<p>&#8220;WordPress is really huge so there is no magical formula for marketing,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;I think what is important is to accept that it takes time. You must keep improving your product forever while being active in the community and do it not only with high intensity but for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The €450K in seed funding Weglot received earlier this year has helped the team to expand its support and development team, but it has also made it possible for the company to invest more in the community. They have now sponsored a dozen WordCamps across the world, including WordCamp Europe in Paris.</p>
<p>Berda&#8217;s advice to other WordPress entrepreneurs who are looking for funding is to consider the option carefully and understand how it will impact the company&#8217;s future and ability to act independently.</p>
<p>&#8220;My recommendation would be to think twice about raising money as it takes time,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;It changes your governance and it temporarily distracts you from your number one focus &#8211; your users. Raise only if you are sure you will have a return with the money invested. Not every business need to raise money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fueled by their success in the WordPress market, Weglot plans to expand into other CMS and e-commerce markets, including BigCommerce and Jimdo, followed by Drupal, Magento, and Joomla. Berda said the company also plans to release an open version of the API for developers to integrate their non-CMS websites built on technologies like Symfony and Laravel.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2018, we will be adding many things: We will start using machine learning to improve the quality of automatic translations,&#8221; Berda said. &#8220;We will also leverage the fact that we are SaaS to add some insights about language usage for the users so they can see what languages are performing better. Finally, we will add extra features to manage multilingual SEO. In terms of monthly recurring revenue, we aim to reach €70,000 in 6 months.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 10 Nov 2017 20:04:34 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The plugin will be able to shed some weight, as core improvements will make Jetpack&#8217;s syntax highlighting and gallery widget obsolete.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.9 incorporates <a href="https://codemirror.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeMirror</a>, which brings syntax highlighting, linting, and auto-completion to the built-in code editors. Jetpack 5.5+ will rely on WordPress to handle syntax highlighting and the Custom CSS module has been updated to be fully compatible with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/22/code-editing-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">core&#8217;s new code editing improvements</a>.</p>

<p>Jetpack 5.5 also adds compatibility for WordPress 4.9&#8217;s <a href="https://wptavern.com/new-core-gallery-widget-targeted-for-wordpress-4-9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new core gallery widget</a>. When users update to 4.9, Jetpack will automatically migrate its own <a href="https://jetpack.com/support/extra-sidebar-widgets/gallery-widget/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gallery widgets</a> to use the widget included in core.</p>
<p>The release also includes several other changes for compatibility with WordPress 4.9:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press This sharing button removed, since the feature is being <a href="https://wptavern.com/press-this-removed-from-wordpress-4-9-in-favor-of-a-plugin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed from core in favor of a plugin</a></li>
<li>Changes to ensure compatibility with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">role and capability updates in WordPress 4.9</a></li>
<li>Remove code for processing Contact Form shortcodes in widgets, as <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-will-support-shortcodes-and-embedded-media-in-the-text-widget" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WordPress adds support for shortcodes in widgets in 4.9</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Jetpack 5.5 also improves the connection process between the plugin and WordPress.com, which should reduce recent issue users have experienced when migrating their sites from HTTP to HTTPS.

It has given people a voice. It has brought people together." /><p>WordPress wasn’t the first blogging platform I tried. My very first blog was set up using Blogspot (now Blogger). I didn’t even know I wanted a blog to tell you the truth. But let me take a step back.</p>
<p>I am a techie. A very “untechie” techie, but a techie nonetheless. I actually went to university with a plan to study mathematics and become an actuarial scientist (math and money made for a perfect career, I thought). After one year of university-level mathematics, I decided that I was done with the subject and I stuck with the computer science courses I had also taken. It turned out I had a knack for programming and was often found in the computer lab, debugging my friends’ assignments.</p>
<p>Following my graduation, I worked for several years as a programmer before deciding that I had no interest in coding for the rest of my life. I moved on and up, studying management and information systems, which led me into more managerial positions. On my way there, I decided that I needed to have a personal website. I bought a domain (not my real name though) and starting looking into building my website.</p>
<p>My very first job out of university had been with a web development company as web administrator, where I had picked up quite a bit of HTML, so I figured it would be easy to just build my own website. While researching the latest and best, it struck me that being able to easily add content would be cool, as I had seen early content management systems used back in that job (Tango, anyone?).</p>
<h3>Blogging Begins</h3>
<p>Suddenly my search results were showing me something called blogging. This was 2005, and blogs were still pretty new. I was excited by the concept, that I could have an easy way to put my thoughts out into cyberspace. I signed up for Blogspot and dove in. For all of 2 days. I wanted to change the design and the layout of my new blog, but I couldn’t. I was stuck in the box that Blogspot provided. A little more searching and I found <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress meant I could install it myself on my own hosting and play around to my heart’s content. It was a techie’s dream. In April 2005, WordPress was at version 1.5 and I was in heaven. I spent days and nights tweaking and customizing my brand new website and blog. I was a WordPresser.</p>
<p>I was an avid blogger, sharing posts everyday — longer thought-pieces and short asides (who remembers that concept?). The blogging community in Jamaica was small but we were an enthusiastic bunch. Many of my friends were still using other platforms, but I was a diehard WordPress lover. They took comfort in the ease of use of their hosted platforms, while I reveled in being able to completely mess my site up myself (and fix it!).</p>
<p>I played with themes, and experimented with plugins. Two years later, I was helping other people set up and customize their WordPress blogs, and doing migrations from Blogspot.</p>
<blockquote><p>I was a WordPress freelancer. I didn’t even know this was a thing people did.</p></blockquote>
<p>It took me several years before I officially created my freelance consultancy, <a href="http://lattitudestudios.com/">L’Attitude Studios</a> and actually looked to bring in clients.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that WordPress is the most popular blogging platform in Jamaica, and is used by many web developers to built CMS-based websites, there is not much of a WordPress community. And despite my reading all about WordCamps and community meetups, I didn’t really think of myself as part of an actual community. WordCamps started back in 2006 and there have been hundreds since, but I only went to my first WordCamp in 2016, in Miami.</p>
<h3>Finding a Place</h3>
<p>The organizers of <a href="http://2016.miami.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Miami</a> made me feel so welcome. They were excited to have me come from Jamaica “just” to attend their event. For the first time, I understood that I have a place in the community, not just as a user. I signed up with the WordPress Community team as an organizer of the WordPress Kingston meetups. Full of enthusiasm I came home, ran a survey to find out how people were using WordPress and declared I was starting local meetups. The sound of crickets followed as the interest was low.</p>
<p>I started a new job and didn’t have time to focus on WordPress, so the meetups fell by the wayside. But I still wanted to contribute. So In 2017, I made the leap to speaking. I decided that there were things I could offer the WordPress community based on my own experiences. <a href="https://2017.ottawa.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Ottawa</a> became the first WordCamp I spoke at.</p>
<p>Again, the WordCamp organizers (one of which I had met at WordCamp Miami) were thrilled to have me travel from Jamaica to participate. Funnily, I had to point out to several people that it took less time to get from Jamaica to Ottawa than it did for those traveling from San Francisco.</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone I met at WordCamp Ottawa made me feel like a part of the WordPress family, like I belonged.</p></blockquote>
<p>I still hadn’t got my local meetups going, but I had started making connections in the WordPress space locally. And there seemed to be more interest. I proposed a series of workshops to the organizer of Caribbean Bloggers’ Week. It wouldn’t quite be a WordCamp, which we wouldn’t get permission for, but we could try to do an educational community event to spur interest and raise awareness. <a href="http://wpinthecity.com/">WP in the City</a> was born! Sadly, it had to be postponed, but it will still take shape for 2018.</p>
<h3>WordCamp US</h3>
<p>Now bitten by the bug, I set my speaking sights even higher and made a submission to <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a>. A month later, I was notified that one of my two proposals was accepted. I was to be a <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/speaker/bianca-welds/">WordCamp US speaker</a>! Now an even bigger part of the WordPress community would be open to me. I set about making plans for Nashville in December.</p>
<p>By the time you read this, I will be able to announce that I was selected as the recipient of the <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/2017/07/21/kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-applications-open/">Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</a>. When they notified me, I didn’t even remember I had applied. Kim Parsell was an active member of the WordPress community until her passing in 2015. She was nicknamed “WPMom” because of the care she took in making sure any member of the WordPress community she met felt welcomed and valued.</p>
<p>Kim was already gone before I actively started taking part in the wider WordPress community. But the community I encountered definitely made me feel welcomed and valued, and now I want to help others feel that way. Going to WordCamp US is going to be an amazing opportunity, in part because of the size and breadth of the community I will get to interact with.</p>
<h3>Bringing it Home</h3>
<p>Jamaica is a small country, an island in the middle of the Caribbean sea. Most people know about our biggest stars (like Bob Marley and Usain Bolt), our culture (reggae music and jerk cooking) or our beaches. The people who go usually remember the people. Our community is what makes us a powerhouse. And I want to tap into that for WordPress.</p>
<p>I want to bring Jamaica into the WordPress community, and bring the WordPress community to Jamaica. I want to get more Jamaicans to WordCamps and actively participating in the WordPress community in other ways (through contributing and meetups).</p>
<blockquote><p>I want to bring more WordPressers to Jamaica to share and exchange knowledge, not just enjoy the beach.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I started out, WordPress was just a tool to get me to my goal. For a long time, I didn’t think much about the people behind WordPress, much less considering getting involved myself. Despite my own technical background, I am a newbie where it comes to WordPress development, having remained a tinkerer for much of the last decade. But WordPress is so much more than just code.</p>
<p>Through WordPress, I have been able to express myself through <a href="http://biancawelds.com/blog">blogging</a> and <a href="http://poetry.biancawelds.com/">poetry</a>. I have been able to help others achieve their own success. I have found people willing to share their knowledge for others (like me) to learn. I have found people willing to hear about my WordPress experiences. I have built a network of contacts always willing to help out.</p>
<p>Reading through the other essays on HeroPress, it is also clear that WordPress has changed lives. It has given people a voice. It has brought people together.</p>
<p>WordPress is community. WordPress is my community.</p>

Responses from Gutenberg&#8217;s leadership initially deflected concerns, presenting the iframe implementation as <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341400365" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an experiment that &#8220;works &#8216;for now'&#8221;</a> but isn&#8217;t what the team would ship.</p>
<p>Instead of getting a response to the specific concerns about performance and accessibility of the iframes approach, Kevin Hoffman was urged to think about the future of meta boxes and &#8220;the cases (if any) that would not be converted to blocks.&#8221; When the developer community is repeatedly asked to test and offer feedback but is met with deflection on issues that are critical to sites using WordPress as a CMS, the GitHub discussions begin to get more heated.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are worried, and getting frustrated and it seems to me that they have every right to do so because the perception is that the team working on Gutenberg has little understanding of how meta boxes are being used, little concern for what the impact will be, and is going to move forward with their vision no matter what,&#8221; Jimmy Smutek, lead developer at the office of external affairs at Johns Hopkins, said in response to a Gutenberg collaborators&#8217; admission to having been <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341922758" rel="noopener" target="_blank">dismissive of feedback</a>.</p>
<p>After several rounds of developers joining the thread to debunk the notion that iframes for meta boxes &#8220;work for now,&#8221; Gutenberg lead developer Matias Ventura <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-342129195" rel="noopener" target="_blank">joined the discussion</a> yesterday and confirmed that the experiment is likely to be dropped fairly soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad the conversation refocused in the end to the topic&#8217;s issue: is the current approach to meta-boxes in an iframe viable? With the answer being no,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;The iframes are an implementation detail I think we can drop relatively easy. So let&#8217;s focus on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also addressed the popular opinion that WordPress should make iterative enhancements to the editor itself (and not the full page) before proceeding with overhauling meta boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What some people have called as the pragmatic approach is not concomitant with the design direction this project has had from the start — heading towards full site customization — and what has dictated our decisions so far,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;Nothing here has to be a final solution, we are exploring what is possible within the design premises and putting it out there for testing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ventura said that not making changes to the other aspects of the edit screen would certainly be the simplest path for Gutenberg to take but that it &#8220;would not be fair to the goals of the project and the long term users of WordPress.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress developer Gary Jones contended that pursuing a more iterative approach would not change the goals of the project but would make it possible for more sites to come along during the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Going one step at a time does not, in any way, compromise the goals of the project,&#8221; Jones said. &#8220;You can still head to full-size customization if that&#8217;s the goal, but by doing it in a stepped way, you&#8217;ll bring the rest of the developer community along with you.&#8221; Jones cited the Customizer as an example of a feature within WordPress with a concept that is being realized over time with many iterations.</p>
<p>Ventura responded with clarification on the Gutenberg team&#8217;s approach to iterating on the project, a paradigm shift that supports block-based content creation from the outset.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have proposed a staged approach, from Matt&#8217;s original new focuses post, it just considers the steps differently,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;There are generally three stages for the Gutenberg project: from the post editor, to page templates, to site building. What is primordial is that the paradigm is one where the content is a single area, with the block as the primary concept, and where the outcome can be visually represented with clarity and without excessive abstractions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ventura also assured those following along on the discussion that the project will not be dropping support for meta boxes but needs more time to experiment with different interface options.</p>
<p>&#8220;WordPress always moves with the user, and we take the burden of figuring out development paths to ease transitions for our existing code,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a project, we have said before that we were not dropping support for meta-boxes from WordPress, but also that we had to explore what interface decisions we would have to make within the new paradigm, including the possibility of loading the classic editor when we detect meta-boxes we cannot handle or that directly conflict with an editor that seeks to more clearly delineate what is content and what is meta-data.&#8221;</p>
<p>He also said the team plans to create more mechanisms to handle incompatibilities as well as &#8220;allowing more things to be opt-in (say if you are comfortable with your meta-boxes showing in Gutenberg you could declare support for it, or vice versa.&#8221;</p>
<p>A new approach to rendering meta boxes without using iframes is currently underway. Riad Benguella has created <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3345" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a pull request that attempts to undo the iframes</a> and implement <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-342023452" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a suggestion that Tom Nowell offered</a> during the discussion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of loading Gutenberg on a settings page, lets load it into the main classic editors page, load metaboxes in their native environment, then hoist their container DOM node into a component via JS.</p>
<p>We then use a different kind of toggle to make sure the classic editor can still be used. This way:</p>
<p>&#8211; we avoid the iframe nonsense<br />
&#8211; metaboxes work as they always have done as far as registration is concerned<br />
&#8211; the existing JS works as expected, and no hacks are necessary to make things work on the PHP end</p></blockquote>
<p>The new approach has the advantage of no problems with links, modals, duplicate stylesheets, and the other drawbacks to using iframes.</p>
<h3>The Gutenberg Team Needs a New Communication Strategy</h3>
<p>The discussion regarding the long-term viability of using iframes for meta boxes has highlighted a lack of a unified message or communication strategy among Gutenberg leads. Collaborators on the project <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341922758" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have grown impatient</a> with the community for not grasping the vision, but communication is scattered across various blogs, comments, Slack channels, and GitHub discussions.</p>
<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen has opened a new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3354" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue</a> requesting a centralized resource that can serve as a plain language outline of Gutenberg&#8217;s scope, direction, and goals.</p>
<p>&#8220;My observation is the community is struggling to see the wider scope of the Gutenberg project due to lack of a single authoritative plain language resource containing this information,&#8221; Rand-Hendriksen said. &#8220;This creates a high degree of speculation, miscommunication, and frustration from all parties and the project suffers as a consequence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gutenberg does have a documentation hub, but so far those documents are more technical and lack a practical roadmap for how the team is aiming to accomplish its goals. The <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/reference/faq/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ section</a> of the current docs is the closest thing to the plain language resource that Rand-Hendriksen is requesting in his ticket. The readme.txt files for both Gutenberg&#8217;s GitHub repository and the WordPress.org plugin give the impression that the project is simply updating the current editor to be block-based, not overhauling the entire editor screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to the fractured nature of this information it is challenging for anyone to get a clear picture of the entire project, and though Matias and Matt&#8217;s posts do a good job at explaining the grand vision of the project, they lack concrete plain language breakdowns of the essentials the community need to get a firm understanding of what this project is and where it&#8217;s headed,&#8221; Rand-Hendriksen said. &#8220;They also exist as independent satellites of information circling the project rather than core parts of the project itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The community is chiming in on the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3354" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue</a> with questions they would like to see answered in a more transparent plain language product roadmap. A document like this might help the Gutenberg team to better communicate the goals of the project and avoid sending mixed messages that cause unnecessary confusion.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Nov 2017 22:58:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Six WordCamps were held over the weekend in cities across the globe, including two in Africa where WordPress events are just starting to take off. Harare and Nairobi hosted their second WordCamps in areas where the WordPress community was virtually non-existent two years ago.</p>
<p>Harare&#8217;s first camp was part of the WordCamp Incubator program the first year it launched. Nairobi was one of a handful of cities on the short list for the same program but ended up organizing its first camp independently in December 2016. Both communities have continued to flourish, as local leadership and meetup groups have grown.</p>
<p>Topics at both Harare and Nairobi WordCamps included freelancing, blogging, marketing, and community, with a sprinkling of more technical sessions. <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/05/blogging-a-new-frontier-for-african-millennials/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blogging is a popular activity in Africa</a> and those in the local WordPress community are eager to share what they have learned in maintaining and marketing their blogs.</p>

<p>WordCamp Europe 2018 has begun <a href="https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/tickets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">early bird ticket sales</a> for its sixth edition in Belgrade, Serbia, June 14-16. Attendees who purchase a ticket before December 31, 2017, will receive a limited-edition swag item.</p>
<p>WordCamp Europe has sold out in many previous years and organizers of the 2017 event in Paris anticipated that it would be the largest event in WordPress history. They expected to host more than 3,000 attendees but the actual number on the ground was 1,900 &#8211; 5% fewer than the 2,000 who attended in Vienna the previous year. WCEU 2017 <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-2017-posts-24-no-show-rate-cites-early-ticket-sales-and-expensive-location" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a 24% no-show rate</a>, which was more than double that of previous years.</p>
<p>Putting tickets on sale too early was one of the factors that contributed to the Paris event&#8217;s high no-show rate, in addition to higher local sales, an expensive location, and attendees&#8217; problems obtaining visas. This year ticket sales are starting a little later and batches will be staged out into 2018.</p>
<p>The WCEU organizing team for Belgrade includes <a href="https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/organizers/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">54 people</a> leading 10 teams to manage sponsors, PR, volunteers, design, and on-site responsibilities. The event has also added a new Attendee Services team that will assist with things like ticket invoices, visa letters, and other services on the ground.</p>
<p>A batch of <a href="https://2018.europe.wordcamp.org/tickets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">1,000 early bird tickets</a> were released today and more than 10% have already been purchased on the first day of sales. Tickets are €40.00 and include two days of presentations, lunch, coffee and snacks, a t-shirt, and a ticket to the After Party. The ticket also gives the attendee access to Contributor Day, which will take place the day before the conference and requires a separate sign up. Tickets are non-refundable but can easily be resold or gifted in the event that the purchaser cannot attend.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 06 Nov 2017 19:54:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>A lively and productive discussion regarding Gutenberg&#8217;s use of iframes for meta boxes is happening on GitHub. Yesterday, WordPress developer Kevin Hoffman created an issue titled &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Are iframes a viable long-term solution for meta boxes?</a>&#8221;</p>
<p>Gutenberg 1.5 introduced <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">initial support for meta boxes</a>. Hoffman identified several issues with iframes that have been popping up as developers have begun testing the current meta box implementation. He did some performance testing that revealed Gutenberg&#8217;s use of iframes triples the number of asset requests, as it enqueues all of the CSS and JS assets in the parent window as well as in all the iframes.</p>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-iframes-request.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>image credit: Kevin Hoffman
<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, iframes have been discouraged in web development for many years for reasons that are well-documented,&#8221; Hoffman said, before citing a litany of issues that plugin developers have already discovered in testing Gutenberg&#8217;s meta box support. &#8220;Can these issues be addressed without requiring modification of the theme or plugin that generates the meta box? We have to consider that third-party code that has powered meta boxes for years may not have the luxury of being updated in order to be compatible within an iframe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister responded to Hoffman&#8217;s concerns, indicating that the current implementation of meta boxes is simply an experiment and not necessarily what would land in WordPress 5.0:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s good to think a little that what we have today for meta boxes in Gutenberg is an experiment, in many respects it&#8217;s a holding pattern as the project works out the direction to take. In saying that it&#8217;s one that works &#8216;for now&#8217; but isn&#8217;t what we would ship with.</p>
<p>All the above said, I think it&#8217;s important to look at what in the future metaboxes will be used for. What are the cases (if any) that would not be converted to blocks? Do all metaboxes have to work on mobile? Is there even an alternative interface that we haven&#8217;t explored? I bet there is. Right now, it&#8217;s about looking at those possibilities and getting on a road that works for the state right now and the future state.</p></blockquote>
<p>The presentation of this implementation as an experiment that &#8220;works for now&#8221; (but would not be shipped) comes as a surprise after Gutenberg 1.5 arrived with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement</a> that &#8220;this release includes long awaited meta-boxes support (needs testing!)&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoffman contends that the iframe approach doesn&#8217;t even work &#8216;for now,&#8217; as the issue was opened in order to cite several major ways where it is broken. If Gutenberg moves forward with the current approach, it would require many plugins to be modified in order to be compatible with WordPress 5.0, which Hoffman said would defeat the whole purpose of supporting legacy meta boxes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have not seen any evidence to date that suggests meta boxes will continue working with Gutenberg,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;If the answer is no, then we ought to stop pretending that 5.0 will be just another WordPress release and start being honest about breaking backwards compatibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Edwin Cromley, a collaborator on the project, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341470058" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> that the team anticipates that certain themes and plugins will be broken and that it is not possible to accommodate every possible use case. He admitted that the iframe solution may not meet the project&#8217;s goals. Instead, he advocates creating the best experience for the vast majority of users.</p>
<p>However, the current approach would adversely affect many sites out there that use WordPress primarily as a CMS with meta boxes. WordPress core committer Scott Taylor <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341500339" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expressed concerns</a> about custom post types, many of which do not make use of the traditional &#8220;content&#8221; section in favor of meta boxes only.</p>
<p>&#8220;In this current iteration, meta box support is an add-on, when in many people&#8217;s reality, meta boxes ARE the UI, the API, the mechanism they use to compose their CMS,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;iframes are the gulag.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we are forgetting the values WP has been built on forever: I should be able to update to the latest version of WP, and have to rewrite nothing. I have so many projects in the wild on WP that I will never touch again. Can I be confident that some of them won&#8217;t break wildly with this change?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hoffman advocated scaling back the scope of the project to focus on the editor component, a popular opinion that many plugin developers share and one that was illustrated in detail in Yoast&#8217;s post proposing an <a href="https://yoast.com/gutenberg-alternative-approach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">alternative approach to Gutenberg</a>. This approach stages out the changes to the edit screen, giving developers more time to update their plugins, as well as allowing the Gutenberg team to find an adequate solution for meta boxes.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-scaled-back.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;I think that goal would be a lot more achievable if Gutenberg stuck to overhauling the editor rather than taking over the entire page,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;Then we could leave the existing hooks in place and meta boxes could continue to communicate with each other as they do now. Also, asset enqueuing would be a non-issue since it would work as it does today.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in strong agreement with this concept put forth by Yoast, which seems to me like it would maintain much of the work already done while scaling back the scope of the project to focus on the editor component.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella indicated the team is not too keen on working towards this concept.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reusing Gutenberg pieces to build this concept is relatively doable, but this is not the UX we want to optimize for, we want to build the best possible editor first and make it available for people without backwards compatibility concerns (fresh installs, no metaboxes&#8230;),&#8221; Benguella said.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we think the ideal vision of Gutenberg is ready to ship, we&#8217;ll have time to discuss upgrade path strategies, a concept like this one is an option for an upgrade path, but definitely not as the final product. Other upgrade paths are also possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>The WordPress developer community is not, however, in favor of delaying this discussion once again. Many are eager to finally answer the question of how meta boxes will fit into the context of the Gutenberg editor so they know how to prepare. Given the numerous issues with the iframes approach, rendering legacy PHP meta boxes under the new editor will require more experimentation and possibly an alternative solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why devote thousands of hours into developing the ideal editor if it cannot be made compatible with existing sites?&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;If the first impression is that it breaks the UI they depend on, users will never experience the ideal editor in the first place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it may be a mistake to put this off too far,&#8221; WordPress core committer Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;Especially since many organizations are going to need at least 1-2 quarters to prepare.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mark Kaplun suggests the Gutenberg team use a popular plugin as a gauge for the success of current and future meta box support experiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;My productive suggestion, is to not declare meta boxes ready, as long as Yoast SEO does not properly work in it,&#8221; Kaplun said. &#8220;It is both slightly complex in terms of interactions and it is installed on shit loads of sites. If Gutenberg cannot work with it, probably no one is going to use it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Greg Schoppe, who has tested and <a href="https://gschoppe.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">written extensively on Gutenberg&#8217;s ongoing development</a>, joined the conversation to advocate for Yoast&#8217;s alternative approach to the project as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I highly support Yoast&#8217;s view of Gutenberg,&#8221; Schoppe said. &#8220;It is unclear to me how &#8216;upgrade the visual editor&#8217; was reinterpreted to be &#8216;replace the entire post edit interface&#8217; by the Gutenberg team, but it seems directly at odds with the so-called &#8216;Ship of Theseus.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;In this case, the lack of clear direction and support for the existing standard workflows is actively hurting developers now. How can I move forward building a project, without a trusted set of hooks and tools that I can rely on? It is unconscionable to think that such a large software project would entirely upend the standard workflow for developers in a single update. and it is insane that these conversations are just happening now, in November, when the plan is to have a merge approved at the beginning of the year.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304" rel="noopener" target="_blank">discussion regarding the iframes approach to meta boxes</a> was opened yesterday is still relatively new, but so far the Gutenberg team&#8217;s responses have failed to adequately address the concerns of the developer community in this thread. Finding an approach to meta boxes that preserves WordPress&#8217; powerful CMS capabilities, without alienating users and developers, is one of the Gutenberg team&#8217;s greatest challenges. They are still aiming at producing a merge proposal early next year, but with meta boxes still in the experimentation stage, the team&#8217;s anticipated timetable continues to put the project at odds with the WordPress developer community.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Nov 2017 23:44:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<h2>HeroPress Publishes Essay Dedicated to Kim Parsell</h2>
<p>Coinciding with the scholarship announcement, HeroPress has <a href="https://heropress.com/essays/family-well-loved/">published an essay</a> that members of the community  contributed too, including myself, in memory of <a href="https://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away">Kim Parsell</a>. The theme of the essay is &#8216;What did the WordPress Community Mean to Kim?&#8217;.</p>
<p>It has been nearly three years since Kim passed away but in my conversations with her online and in the physical world, I understood what the community meant to her. It meant family, a responsibility she took very seriously. I highly encourage you to read the essay and the beautiful things people had to say about Kim. She is missed by many but her spirit lives on.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 03 Nov 2017 08:07:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Press This, a tool that allowed users to quickly clip and publish content from web pages, is set to be <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/11/02/press-this-in-4-9/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed from WordPress&#8217; upcoming 4.9 release</a>. The feature is being retired and will live out its remaining days as a canonical <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plugin</a>.</p>
<p>WordPress contributors opted to make a clean break by completely removing Press This and its supporting functions from core. After 4.9 is released, users visiting <strong>wp-admin/press-this.php</strong> will be prompted to install the plugin from WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/press-this-plugin-prompt.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>A revamped version of Press This <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/press-this-revamp-merge-proposal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">landed in WordPress 4.2</a>, released two years ago. Contributors had been talking about switching it to use the REST API instead of admin-ajax since the <a href="https://wptavern.com/preview-the-press-this-bookmarklet-redesign-alpha-plugin-now-ready-for-testing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2014 redesign of the bookmarklet</a>. This update is still on the plugin&#8217;s roadmap for anyone interested in contributing to its development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Following the importers and the link manager, it&#8217;s about time to say goodbye to Press This,&#8221; WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz said in a <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41689" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ticket</a> proposing the feature&#8217;s retirement. &#8220;Bookmarklets were popular seven &#8211; eight years ago, and now are considered mostly &#8216;old tech.&#8217; The Press This usage was dwindling for the last several years. Currently it is at under 0.2% of the wp-admin requests (as far as I can tell). It seems best to extract it from core to a plugin, similarly to the importers.&#8221;</p>
<h3>What Use is Press This without the Bookmarklet?</h3>
<p>Development on Press This&#8217; accompanying bookmarklet feature has also been discontinued. Older bookmarklets will not work with the new canonical plugin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usage of bookmarklets across the web has decreased significantly and bad actors attempting to trick users to preform unsavory actions increased over the years,&#8221; Brandon Kraft said in a post announcing Press This&#8217; retirement. &#8220;Coupled with advancing toward a new editing in experience in core, we decided it was a suitable time to make these changes in one swift move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heavy users of Press This might wonder what the feature is worth without the bookmarklet. Posting through the interface will now require more copying and pasting. The URL scanning remains, but it&#8217;s not as efficient as highlighting a portion of text on a page and clicking on the bookmarklet to auto-populate a new post in WordPress. This change makes the plugin simpler to maintain but removes the time-saving feature that made Press This feel like magic.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the rise of bad actors attempting to trick folks to entering their credentials via phishing attempts, I removed the functionality in an effort to not promote requesting credentials after firing off JavaScript on a random site,&#8221; Kraft said. &#8220;To set expectations, I am not foreseeing a change in this decision; however, I support continued conversation and dialogue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kraft opened a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/press-this/issues/15" rel="noopener" target="_blank">issue</a> on the plugin&#8217;s new <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/press-this" rel="noopener" target="_blank">repository</a> to centralize any discussion regarding restoring the bookmarklet functionality.</p>
<p>Any plugin authors who have extended Press This will need to update their plugins with a check for plugin availability as demonstrated in <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/press-this.php" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wp-admin/press-this.php</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 22:18:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>GitHub <a href="https://github.community/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched its new community forums</a> this week as another way for the platform&#8217;s 24 million developers to stay connected. The company built them on top of the <a href="https://www.lithium.com/products/online-communities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lithium SaaS community platform</a>, a popular choice for enterprise customers, including Sony, Cisco, HP, Skype, Barclaycard, Symantec, Google, and PayPal.</p>
<p>The first iteration of the forums includes a gamification aspect that rewards participants for interaction and contribution. Users can &#8220;rank up&#8221; by receiving &#8220;Kudos&#8221; and providing solutions to questions on the forums. GitHub plans to expand on these features in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-02-at-12.47.22-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>Naturally, this style of ranking and participation led users to be curious whether GitHub is aiming to have its forums become a StackOverflow Q&amp;A platform alternative. When asked what the company had in mind when designing this feature, GitHub Community Manager Nadia Padzensky <a href="https://github.community/t5/Welcome/What-are-the-primary-use-cases-for-community-forum/m-p/286/highlight/false#M81" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said</a> the forums provide another avenue for open discussion on ideas and general questions unrelated to specific projects.</p>
<p>&#8220;Issues don’t always lend themselves well to these kinds of discussions; however, a forum presents a place designed specifically for these types of conversations,&#8221; Padzensky said. &#8220;In the past, we’ve not had a GitHub-owned space for users to engage with each other in this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>GitHub has also launched an educational section called <a href="https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Original-Series/ct-p/GitHubOriginalSeries" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GitHub Original Series</a> with articles from staff on workflows and features, written on topics that users often ask about in private support emails. The team plans to build out this section of the site while adding more features to the forums.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking to add contests, polls, and better processes and tooling for taking user feature requests,&#8221; Padzensky said. &#8220;Additionally, the Community Forum will adapt to its members needs; Community Forum member activity and feedback will directly help inform what the Community Forum evolves into.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ability to keep in touch with its user base is perhaps the most important function the forums will provide to GitHub. It offers a space where users can discussion problems they are having with GitHub&#8217;s products and have those concerns heard by staff. This could potentially help the company avoid public relations disasters like last year&#8217;s when a group of open source project maintainers confronted GitHub with an open letter of complaints regarding issue management. The company <a href="https://wptavern.com/github-responds-to-letter-from-open-source-project-maintainers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">admitted to having become disconnected from the needs of its open source community</a> and promised to launch new features that would better serve community-led projects, as well as make it easer for developers to offer feedback on the products it is building.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 19:00:17 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<h2>WordPress Charity Hackathons are Growing</h2>
<p>For the last few years, the number of <a href="https://doaction.org/">do_action series of WordPress charity hackathons</a> has grown around the world. What started as a community event to assist local nonprofit organizations, has become something many WordPress communities are replicating in an increasing number of cities.</p>
<p>As of this month, do_action events have been hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, Beirut, Lebanon, Austin, Texas, and Montréal, Canada. In addition, events are now scheduled for <a href="https://doaction.org/event/bristol-2018/">Bristol, England</a> and <a href="https://doaction.org/event/zurich-2018/">Zurich, Switzerland</a> in 2018.</p>
<p>To get involved in organizing a do_action event locally, read <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/">the do_action organizer’s handbook</a> and join the #community-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>
<h2>Gutenberg Development Advances</h2>
<p>While work steadily continues on Gutenberg — the new editor for WordPress core — one update from this month addresses one of the primary concerns that some people shared about the project.</p>
<p>Up until <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/">the release on October 24</a>, Gutenberg did not support the meta boxes that so many WordPress content creators rely on. The new editor now has initial support for meta boxes as well as a host of other critical features for content creation in WordPress.</p>
<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">Test out Gutenberg</a> right now and help develop it by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">Core team blog</a>.</p>

<p>As an interim update to my <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/05/whats-in-my-bag-2017/">2017 gear post</a>, I&#x27;d like to strongly endorse the <a href="https://www.aersf.com/fit-pack-2-black/">Aer Fit Pack 2</a> as my new primary backpack, replacing the Lululemon bag I suggested before. It has better material, much better zippers, a logical design, more pocket distribution inside, and it&#x27;s cheaper!

The block toolbar has been <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2998" rel="noopener" target="_blank">relocated to the top of the editor</a>, a suggestion that was mocked up and described in detail in a post on the Yoast SEO blog proposing <a href="https://yoast.com/gutenberg-alternative-approach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an alternative approach for Gutenberg</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to version 1.6, users could inadvertantly end up in a situation like the screenshot below &#8211; with tools and toggles popping into view from all sides of a block.</p>
<a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-5.17.46-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Gutenberg prior to version 1.6
<p>Previously, any small mouse move would pull the block toolbar back into view, which made for a somewhat jarring writing experience. Gutenberg 1.6 makes the block toolbar completely independent of the content by fixing it to the top of the editor. This move reduces the amount of visual distraction in the writing zone, while keeping the toolbar accessible in a way that is familiar to users coming from the Classic Editor.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-5.24.34-PM-e1509575932134.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The toolbar will automatically adjust to display tools specific to the block type that is in focus, so that users don&#8217;t have to sift through other tools that are not applicable to that specific type of content. It does not show if no blocks are selected.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-block-toolbar.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>In the ticket proposing the change, Gutenberg designer Joen Asmussen describes it as part of a larger effort to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2983" rel="noopener" target="_blank">try to reduce the visual weight of the block</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The cognitive load of the chrome we show around and in context of the block unit has been an ongoing topic for a while,&#8221; Asmussen said. &#8220;Concerns have been noted that it feels heavy, there are many toolbars, options, and it gets in the way of writing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Placing the block toolbar to the top of the editor is a strong move toward making blocks feel lighter, and version 1.6 includes several other UI tweaks along the same theme. It introduces an alternate style for block boundaries and multi-selection that removes the previous hover and selected styles for blocks, which were somewhat heavy-handed and distracting. Instead, hovering over blocks will simply bring the floating settings dots into view on the side of the block. Contributors also redesigned the selection styles to be more subtle, making the separator, more, and button UI items feel more lightweight.</p>
<p>Other visual changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage &#8220;edit&#8221; mode when using arrow keys (hides UI)</li>
<li>Complete rework of arrow keys navigation between blocks—faster, clearer, and respects caret position while traversing text blocks</li>
<li>Added keyboard shortcuts to navigate regions</li>
<li>Implement multi-selection mode using just arrow with shift keys and support horizontal arrows</li>
<li>Change visual style of multi-selected blocks so it has the same color as highlighted text does</li>
</ul>
<p>Gutenberg 1.6 introduces the ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3179" rel="noopener" target="_blank">convert a classic block (post) into several Gutenblocks</a>. The resulting divided block is fairly instantaneous.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-6.47.03-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Version 1.5</a> of the plugin added initial support for meta boxes in an Extended Settings panel beneath the post content. Version 1.6 changes the UI to make meta boxes part of the main column, instead of a collapsible box. Plugin developers had complained that the UI gave the impression of having been pinned to the bottom as &#8220;a bit of an afterthought.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the current design does meta boxes a real disservice,&#8221; one tester, Patrick B., <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor#comment-238575" rel="noopener" target="_blank">commented</a> on our post. &#8220;The current layout and the section heading, “Extended Settings,” makes it look and feel like a bit of an afterthought. Undoubtably, many meta boxes will be able to be moved to their own blocks, but there will still be situations where what is contained under Extended Settings is essential to putting together a page but isn’t appropriate as a block. In that case, Extended Settings just doesn’t feel right and seems easily forgettable. That could create an awkward publishing experience, especially when those fields are required to publish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meta boxes now appear below the content without the Extended Settings label and individual accordion items are toggled closed by default. The bottom section appears regardless of whether or not the sidebar Settings panel is toggled open, so it is always there. This is a change from the previous release where toggling the sidebar Settings panel open was required to see the Extended Settings panel.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-7.04.00-PM.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://scotch.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Scotch School</a>, a developer resource with video training and tutorials, is offering its <a href="https://scotch.io/courses/getting-started-with-javascript" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Getting Started with JavaScript for Web Development</a> course for free through the end of this week. If you&#8217;re just now getting started on your journey to <a href="https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learning JavaScript deeply</a>, this 23-lesson video course from <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisoncode" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Chris Sevilleja</a> offers a quick foundation on the basics with 4.7 hours of learning and hands-on practice.</p>
<p>The course includes lessons that introduce students to the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types and Variables</li>
<li>Operators</li>
<li>Comparisons</li>
<li>Conditionals, Flow, and Loops</li>
<li>Functions</li>
<li>Objects</li>
<li>Built-in Objects</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the fundamentals, students move on to build a couple of starter applications. At the end of the course Sevilleja guides students through building a bookmarking type application for grabbing links from the web and storing them in local storage. Code for the course is available on GitHub and requires a basic set of tools: a browser with support for ES6 features, DevTools and the console, and a code editor.</p>
<p>The course is targeted at those who have already learned HTML and CSS but don&#8217;t know JavaScript yet. It&#8217;s also helpful for developers who have jumped into jQuery, Angular, React, or other libraries but haven&#8217;t taken the time to learn the core language first.</p>
<p>The Scotch School has two other free courses at the moment: <a href="https://scotch.io/courses/10-need-to-know-javascript-concepts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">10 Need to Know JavaScript Concepts</a> and <a href="https://scotch.io/courses/build-an-online-shop-with-vue" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Build an Online Shop with Vue</a>.

Kim Parsell, 1956-2015" /><p>There are times when I hear a story from the WordPress community and I think &#8220;That&#8217;s a HeroPress story&#8221;, whether it has been or ever will actually be posted on the site. Some stories are just so great that you think &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s just really great&#8221;. This week&#8217;s essay is one of those stories, but it won&#8217;t be told by the person it&#8217;s about.</p>
<p>Kim Parsell has one of my absolute favorite HeroPress stories, but we lost her before HeroPress was even properly started. I&#8217;ve keenly felt the loss of the wisdom and joy she would have brought to HeroPress. I only met her in person once, at the last WordCamp San Francisco. She was so very much in her element, even I could see it, who barely knew her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve literally spent years now, trying to think of an appropriate way to share her story on HeroPress, and I think this year I found it. The WordPress community was Kim&#8217;s family, and she was our mom. I&#8217;m going to let some of the people closest to her tell some of her story.</p>
<p>&#8212; Topher</p>
<blockquote class="light"><p><em>From Jeff Chandler</em></p>
<p>What did the WordPress community mean to Kim Parsell? Family.</p>
<p>In order to understand how highly valued the WordPress community was to Kim Parsell, you first have to realize her environment.</p>
<p>Kim was a middle-aged woman who lived off a dirt road, on top of a hill, in Southern rural Ohio. She was often by herself, taking care of the property with only a few neighbors up and down the road.</p>
<p>She received internet access from towers that broadcasted wireless signals, similar to cell phones but at lower speeds.</p>
<p>Through WordPress Weekly, Kim gained access to members of the WordPress community where she was able to talk to them on a weekly basis. The show and its after hours sessions provided Kim a chance to mingle with the who&#8217;s who of WordPress at the time. It helped establish long-lasting relationships that would open up future opportunities.</p>
<p>In a location where not many around her used or even heard of WordPress, the community was an outlet for her to be around like-minded people. Kim had a blast interacting with people online and at WordCamp events. Many members of the WordPress community became her second family, a responsibility she took very seriously.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="light"><p><em>From Carrie Dils</em></p>
<p>When Topher asked me if I&#8217;d write a few words in remembrance of Kim, I couldn&#8217;t say YES fast enough. I told him I remembered a whole lot more about how she made me feel versus how she felt about WordPress and the community. (I suppose the saying is true that people don&#8217;t remember what you say, they remember how you made them feel).</p>
<p>I first remember meeting Kim on Twitter, so I went back and did a search to the earliest <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40cdils%20AND%20%40kimparsell&src=typd&lang=en">conversations of ours</a> I could find. They dated back to January 2013, nearly two years to the date after she passed in January 2015. I will always remember Kim, along with Mika Epstein and Andrea Rennick, for their kindness to me when I was new to the community. They were the first &#8220;women of WordPress&#8221; to draw me in and make me feel at home simply by sharing themselves and their knowledge.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what community is, right? You share things that are personal, vulnerable even. You share your experiences. In doing that, you naturally invite others to reciprocate. That&#8217;s the environment Kim created with hundreds of others, not just me. Affectionately called #wpmom, Kim was an investor. She invested countless hours into the WordPress project (she had &#8220;props&#8221; for 5 major releases of WP and also volunteered her time for the documentation team). She invested in women who wanted to break into tech. She invested in me.</p>
<p><a href="https://carriedils.com/for-you-kim/">I still well up with tears</a> when I remember Kim. I&#8217;m proud that the WordPress Foundation now offers a scholarship in her memory. She loved this community and this community loved her right back. Her legacy lives on&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="light"><p><em>From Jayvie Arellano</em></p>
<p>Kim was a self-reliant person who had a nurturing spirit, and WordPress gave her a channel by which she can channel that energy. I believe that her participation in WordCamps and the docs team enriched her life; every WC she went to, there was always someone she&#8217;s known online that she would connect with and check up on. She was concerned with everyone&#8217;s well-being.</p>
<p>She wouldn&#8217;t be a coder in our common understanding, but she understood coders. She understood the pitfalls of an isolated life and encouraged people to reach out and be concerned for one another. Her record of kindness and generosity have set an example for a lot of others to follow.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="light"><p><em>From Jan Dembowski</em></p>
<p>Kim Parsell was the sort of person who made me want to become a better human being. And the reciprocal of that is that I sought her approval for what I did, how I behaved and how I handled myself in the WordPress community and in life.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, she never said or did anything that indicated that her approval was needed. Or that it was a condition for her friendship. But she was #wpmom and that’s just how it was for me. Our online interactions were fun and collaborating with her in the WordPress community was a learning experience for me. I used that experience to become better at my job and it showed.</p>
<p>When I had to deal with a death in my family, she was one of the people I emailed. I needed that interaction and she was there for me with others in the community.</p>
<p>I met Kim in person at WordCamp SF 2014. She was amazed at how everyone was treating her. All these people she had contact with and everyone was thrilled to meet her. When the time came, she gave a video presentation on the docs team. She was nervous, had some laptop troubles and didn’t feel prepared. She did fine and I was there cheering her on from the sidelines.</p>
<p>After WCSF 2014 we stayed in touch and I would send her images of things my children did. When I got the news of her passing it was hard. But she left an amazing example. She taught me and others to take care of yourself, take care of those close to you and be a responsible person. How often do you meet someone like that? I’m so glad for having met her. Just by being herself she made me a better person.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="light"><p><em>From Drew Jaynes</em></p>
<p>Kim Parsell was driven. She knew the things she knew, and had a pretty good idea of how to find out the things she didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be amazed how far the simple quality of that &#8220;self starter&#8221; attitude can take you as a contributor.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not intentionally diminishing Kim to simply having the will to pull herself up by her proverbial boot straps. It&#8217;s merely to demonstrate the point that Kim&#8217;s temperament and poise in unfamiliar situations was unmatched, and that is one of the reasons why she was able to affect so much positive change in WordPress.</p>
<p>Kim&#8217;s positive attitude and helping nature was infectious. She had the uncanny ability to walk into a room of complete strangers and walk out with a group of new friends – and newly-gleaned knowledge to go along with it.</p>
<p>When Kim visited WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WordCamp US) for the first time in 2014, it was hugs all around. Literally. Kim had been contributing to WordPress for years and largely never met many of the people she&#8217;d had an opportunity to collaborate with.</p>
<p>The community summit was being held in conjunction with WCSF that year and the only way she could afford to go was on a travel scholarship offered at the time by the foundation – the same scholarship that now justly bears her name.</p>
<p>It was an amazing thing to see, made all the more tragic when Kim left us just a few short months later. She was well on her way to realizing her goal of being able to contribute full time and get paid for her effort.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sad to say Kim never got there, but her spirit lives on in the people she knew and inspired. Here&#8217;s hoping that the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship will serve to further inspire those who follow in her footsteps.</p></blockquote>

This release addresses an issue with $wpdb-&gt;prepare() that could lead to a potential SQL injection. While WordPress core is not vulnerable, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)">hardening</a> has been added to prevent plugins and themes from inadvertently causing a vulnerability.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing a bit of déjà vu, it&#8217;s because WordPress 4.8.2 <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/">attempted to solve</a> the same problem. <a href="https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-background.html">According</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/ircmaxell">Anthony Ferrara</a> who <a href="https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-technical.html">reported and disclosed</a> the vulnerability, the patch in 4.8.2 didn&#8217;t solve the underlying problem and broke many sites.</p>
<p>Ferrara says he reported the issue immediately after 4.8.2 was released and was ignored by the WordPress security team for several weeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I got the attention of the team, they wanted to fix a subset of the issue I reported,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It became clear to me that releasing a partial fix was worse than no fix (for many reasons). So I decided the only way to make the team realize the full extent was to Full Disclosure the issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Full Disclosure is the process of publicly sharing technical details of a vulnerability so that the public knows the same amount of information about it as hackers. The threat of full disclosure is typically used to pressure businesses and software creators to act swiftly and release patches as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On October 26th, Ferrara used his Twitter account to <a href="https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/923662170092638208">notify the public</a> that WordPress contained a serious SQLi vulnerability and that because he lacked confidence in the team, fully disclosing it was his only option. His message was retweeted 562 times and liked by 484 people.</p>
<p>The amount of publicity his Tweet received had an impact as on October 27th, Ferrara reported that constructive discussions resumed with the team and that he would delay the disclosure until October 31st.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">RE: WP Issue: I constructive discussions have resumed with the security team. I will be delaying FD until at earliest the 31st.</p>
<p>&mdash; Anthony Ferrara (@ircmaxell) <a href="https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/923907743555178496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>On October 27th, Ferrara spoke to a member of the WordPress security team who provided a fresh set of eyes to the problem, &#8220;A security team member who hadn’t yet participated in the thread went back to the beginning of the thread and re-read every post,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;He (correctly I may add) summarized the entirety of the issues, as well as asked a few clarifying questions. He also asked for a little more time but gave me a target of Tuesday, October 31st so it wasn’t wide open. This was the response I was looking for the entire time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both parties collaborated on a patch that fixed the issue and WordPress 4.8.3 was released. Although his experience started out frustrating, Ferrara is hopeful that the team will do better with future reports.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get that there are competing priorities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But show attention. Show that you’ve read what’s written. And if someone tells you it seems like you don’t understand something, stop and get clarification. And ask for help. Overall, I hope the WP security team moves forward from this. I do honestly see hope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aaron Campbell, WordPress Security Team Lead, says that although there were some rough patches in working with Ferrara, they were able to work together to get a fix released in the end. While the threat of full disclosure didn&#8217;t have a huge impact on getting the vulnerability patched, it may have been the catalyst to get a new person involved in the process.</p>
<p>&#8220;A threat of disclosure certainly adds pressure and possibly stress, but doesn’t actually change the overall equation that much.&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;An issue isn’t more severe because it’s going to be disclosed, but it can become more rushed (meaning a higher likelihood of mistakes).</p>
<p>In this case, I actually think the threat of disclosure ended up coinciding with one of the people from our security team joining in to help out. The new person was much better at communicating with Anthony, and it really turned things around.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the official release post, the WordPress Security Team thanked Ferrara for practicing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/">Responsible Disclosure</a>. This generated some conversation on Twitter on whether responsible disclosure should be renamed to coordinated disclosure.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear WordPress:</p>
<p>Stop calling it "responsible disclosure". It's "coordinated disclosure".</p>
<p>&mdash; Scott Arciszewski (@CiPHPerCoder) <a href="https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/925384513307504641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>

<p>WordCamp Denmark organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/kaaremulvad" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kåre Mulvad Steffensen</a> and WP Pusher creator <a href="https://wppusher.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Peter Suhm</a> are working on a <a href="https://www.gdprwp.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GDPR for WordPress</a> project that aims to provide an industry standard for getting plugins compliant with EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation. The deadline for compliance is May 28, 2018, approximately 200 days from now. The Danish duo met at WordCamp Europe a few years ago and were inspired to work together on several projects, with GDPR compliance for WordPress sites being the most urgent item on their list.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to create a standard for plugin creators to describe what kind of data they store and how to handle it,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;With a standard like this it will be possible to build tools to make WP sites compliant with GDPR. That basically means things like generating privacy policies, tools to export sensitive data, and tools to delete it completely. GDPR is pretty complex, so there will likely be a lot of tools around this. The first thing we need is a standard. It&#8217;s critical especially for EU based companies, and I can tell you that it&#8217;s something people discuss in every meetup and WordCamp over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The GDPR for WordPress site includes a summary of website owners&#8217; obligations in regards to collecting data related to EU citizens. It&#8217;s not comprehensive but gives an idea of what items the standard will need to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell the user: who you are, why you collect the data, for how long and who receives it.</li>
<li>Get a clear consent, before collecting any data</li>
<li>Let users access their data, and take it with them</li>
<li>Let users delete their data</li>
<li>Let users know if data breaches occur</li>
</ul>
<p>Steffensen and Suhm&#8217;s first step is <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/U9zp6rS1HSDcKZI42" rel="noopener" target="_blank">surveying WordPress plugin developers</a> to gauge their awareness of the GDPR. They also want to know if developers would be interested in using a free, open source solution, like a simple file with a map of personal and sensitive data stored by their plugins. The GDPR for WordPress team would then use the tool as a foundation to build tools that can take care of compliance by parsing these files.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we have the survey data we will continue to work on the standard,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;It will be 100% open source, so everyone can use it to build whatever they see fit afterwards. So far it&#8217;s just a lot of ideas and we really want to collect as much input as possible so we can get everyone onboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team has created a roadmap that that they will update based on feedback from plugin developers. They plan to work on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methodology to describe how a plugin collects, stores, and uses personal data</li>
<li>Methodology file builder for plugin developers to use</li>
<li>Provide a clear visual compliance indicator on every plugin installed</li>
<li>Privacy policy text builder based on installed (compliant) plugins</li>
<li>Provide an administrative overview on each users data being stored, across plugins</li>
<li>Provide an administrative way to send user data to a specific user upon request</li>
<li>Provide an administrative way to delete user data on a specific user upon request</li>
<li>Add site wide Explicit consent checkbox, with detailed yet plain English on what data is stored, how it is used and how long. (This is a replacement for the cookie popup) – possible disablement of submitting actions until consent is given? The request to collect data should happen to every user before any data is collected, that might also mean cookies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite the quickly approaching deadline, solutions aimed at helping WordPress sites to be compliant with the GDPR are virtually non-existent. There are currently only <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/GDPR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">six plugins in the directory</a> with descriptions that mention having been built with GDPR compliance and privacy in mind. Many site owners will be woefully unprepared to comply with the legislation.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago we looked the <a href="https://wptavern.com/gravity-forms-stop-entries-plugin-aims-to-help-sites-comply-with-the-eus-gdpr" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wider Gravity Forms Stop Entries plugin</a>, which helps site owners protect the privacy of form submissions by preventing them from being stored in the database. Since many plugins don&#8217;t have these options built in, other plugin developers have to extend them to suit their users&#8217; needs. At the moment, there is no standard way of doing this because of the wide variance in how plugins store their data.</p>
<p>This solution the GDPR for WordPress team is proposing is different in that it aims to give plugin authors a standard for including a meta description of the personal and sensitive data that their plugins stores. The GDPR doesn&#8217;t prohibit plugins from storing personal identifiable data but it does require website owners to detail what, where, and for what purpose it is stored.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem right now is that it is almost impossible to figure out what information a WordPress plugin stores and where it is stored,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;This will make it possible to build general solutions across plugins to ensure GDPR compliance. An example could be a tool to delete sensitive data from a WordPress site, including the data stored by plugins. That is only possible if plugin authors include some sort of description of their &#8216;data footprint.'&#8221;</p>
<p>The biggest challenge the team has is rallying plugin developers to get on board with following a new standard and updating their plugins to provide a data footprint. This is not an easy task as the burden of compliance falls to the website owners, not individual plugin developers. Even if site owners are motivated to educate themselves, the prospect of figuring out what data is being stored and where can be daunting. If the GDPR for WordPress team can successfully get the plugin developer community on board, they can work together to build a suite of tools that help end users get a broad overview of their sites&#8217; GDPR compliance.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 23:20:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Scott is the founder of <a href="https://hollerwp.com/">Holler Box</a> and the co-founder of <a href="https://apppresser.com/">AppPresser</a>.</em></p>
<p>The WordPress economy is changing, and many businesses are feeling it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://poststatus.com/future-wordpress-economy-im-not-worried/">market is maturing</a>, and <a href="http://chrislema.com/wordpress-economy-shrinking/">customers are behaving differently</a>. It&#8217;s happening slowly, but I think everyone realizes things are changing.</p>
<p>Often this change has been discussed in terms of hosts and agencies, but let&#8217;s talk about products.</p>
<p>I just read an article on Indie Hackers about MH Themes, a premium theme shop that started in 2013. They describe a <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/mh-themes">hard-fought journey</a> to a solid $30K in monthly revenue, but they have noticed big changes in the market since they started.</p>
<p>The author, Michael Hebenstreit, puts it this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Back in 2013 it was much easier to launch a WordPress theme and make it somewhat popular. Today the market for WordPress themes has become heavily crowded and oversaturated. It&#8217;s near to impossible to make a theme highly successful without investing lots of time and money in marketing and building a community behind your product.</p></blockquote>
<p>It comes as no surprise that the theme business is saturated; it <a href="http://scottbolinger.com/wordpress-theme-business/">has been for years</a>. I would now say the plugin business is saturated as well.</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2010 you could have released just about any decent plugin or theme, and it would have done fairly well, simply because there was very little competition. The WordPress market was in an early and extreme growth phase. People were realizing there was money to be made.</p>
<p>Many different product categories were ripe for innovation, with no dominant players at all. For example, the eCommerce landscape was wide open before WooCommerce became popular in 2011. Now there is no one even remotely close to them, and <a href="https://ithemes.com/exchange/">competing</a> with WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t seem like a good idea.</p>
<p>Today what we see in most product categories is at least one dominant player, and many other new entrants at their heels. Backups, security, SEO, themes, page builders, forms, caching, lead generation, and other categories all have stiff competition.</p>
<p>Previously the competition was a developer trying to figure out how to grow a company. Now it&#8217;s a 30+ person organization with millions of dollars in revenue. iThemes, Yoast, Gravity Forms, Awesome Motive, and WooCommerce are just a few. These companies have a loyal following that makes it harder for smaller shops to take a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Popular plugins now have millions of downloads, lots of articles written about them, and avid fans. They are becoming harder and harder to dethrone, or even to challenge for a slice of market share.</p>
<h3>Your product is a commodity</h3>
<p>As Alex Turnbull says <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/commoditization">in this recent article</a>, &#8220;if your product isn&#8217;t already a commodity, it will become one in the next few years.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s becoming easier and easier to create and sell a product online. Developers are ubiquitous, websites are cheap, and many people can build something on the side with a full time job.</p>
<p>That means when you release a product you not only have the established leaders to contend with, but lots smaller players with great products just getting started. Even if your product is great, there are 10 other great products in the same category.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean a great product isn&#8217;t important — it certainly is. It does mean that it&#8217;s not enough.</p>
<p>If your product isn&#8217;t enough to stand out in a crowded marketplace, what does it take?</p>
<h3>How to bring a new product to market now</h3>
<p>The old way of starting a new product might have been to go where there was less competition and create a better product. If there are still places of &#8220;less competition&#8221; they are much harder to see.</p>
<p>You can go after a niche, but WordPress is already a niche. A niche within a niche is a very small market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not impossible to slay the giant Goliath product companies. As <a href="https://blog.asmartbear.com/compete-on-profit.html">Jason Cohen</a> points out, they have an Achilles heel: &#8220;The profitable revenue stream is a prison.&#8221; They are slower to adapt to changes in the marketplace because they can still make money doing what they have always done.</p>
<p>If you are thinking about bringing a new product to market, here are a few observations that may help you.</p>
<h4>1) It&#8217;s going to be a lot harder than it used to be, and it&#8217;s going to take longer.</h4>
<p>Can you go for a year (or two) without making any money and still be cranking out code and marketing yourself? That may be what it takes.</p>
<p>Putting up a website and starting a content strategy takes six months to see any solid organic traffic. Publishing your plugin to official WordPress directory does not result in automatic downloads. The newer search algorithms favor the entrenched plugins that have more downloads and reviews.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an uphill battle, and it takes time.</p>
<h4>2) You must have a strategic advantage, or a unique difference to win.</h4>
<p>Ninja Forms went into a crowded space against one of the most popular plugins of all time, Gravity Forms. They gained an advantage by offering a free version and distributing it on the directory, while Gravity Forms was entirely commercial. Why did they do so much better than other free form plugins? I don’t know, but they certainly executed well, and they have created a great brand.</p>
<p>Can you find a competitive advantage and exploit it?</p>
<p>One weakness I see in many WordPress companies is marketing. Many of the early successes in WordPress were coders who made a cool plugin. Most of them are not marketers, and they have enough business without needing to learn marketing. This leaves the door open for companies with great marketing.</p>
<p>Can you dominate an under-marketed product category?</p>
<p>You are going to have to do something different and better than what has come before. Copying a business model that worked in 2012 is not a good strategy.</p>
<h4>3) Branding is more important than ever.</h4>
<p>Your brand is what will help you gain market share against your competitors.</p>
<p>A brand is not your logo, and it’s not what you say about your company. It’s what they say. They, as in, your customers.</p>
<p>Providing great customer service, getting to know people at events, being helpful on social media, providing refunds without asking questions — these are all parts of your brand. Being known for doing good work is another, so that when you release a new product, people just buy it.</p>
<p>I think of the brand Pippin Williamson has built for himself, since he is known for putting out high quality products. I will buy a plugin he makes over a more established competitor because of his reputation for quality. iThemes is another great example of a company that cares about their customers. They have built a brand on integrity.</p>
<p>Building a brand takes time, but it is more important than ever.</p>
<h3>Looking forward</h3>
<p>The WordPress market is no longer high growth and low competition.</p>
<p>The companies involved in products are maturing into well staffed, well funded operations. Their fans are loyal, and their products are entrenched. This makes it harder for new entrants into the market to compete.</p>
<p>New products must have a well thought out strategy to gain traction in this competitive marketplace. Without unique positioning and hard fought execution, they will not survive.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news, because this is how most marketplaces look already. It’s a sign that those of us who make products need to get more creative about how we approach product development and marketing.</p>
<p>As the more successful companies get larger, they will also become more resistant to change. When this happens, newer product offerings will be able to steal market share with fast paced innovation and development.</p>

<p>Two years ago, WordPress developer Robert DeVore launched <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">WP Dispensary</a>, a free marijuana dispensary menu plugin for WordPress, and has since built an accompanying theme, additional free add-ons, and six commercial extensions. DeVore is aiming to make WP Dispensary a complete online menu software solution for dispensaries and delivery services. The business has grown enough over recent months for him to begin working full-time on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the larger objectives going full time with WP Dispensary was to put together content that was specific for both dispensary owners and freelance WordPress developers,&#8221; Devore said. &#8220;There is a 50/50 split with buyers, so I know that writing content to outline how WPD can help you specifically is an important next step.&#8221;</p>
<p>Due to recent demand seen in pre-sales questions, DeVore has just released a Dispensary Details plugin to meet the needs of the much larger market of customers using WooCommerce. The plugin does not require WP Dispensary to work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of leaving a need out there, I looked at WP Dispensary and knew I could create a standalone plugin that added the proper details and displayed cleanly within the WooCommerce structure,&#8221; DeVore said.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/dispensary-details-for-woocommerce/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dispensary Details for WooCommerce</a> plugin is the first of its kind for the e-commerce platform. It adds custom taxonomies and metaboxes that allow store owners to add cannabis details to products, including information like compound details, aromas, effects, conditions, vendors, symptoms, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dispensary-details-front-end-table.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The plugin includes separate Edibles and Topicals details boxes where store owners can enter THC/CBD per serving, size, serving count, and net weight. It also has a Grower Details box for cannabis shops that sell clones or seeds with specific sections for origin, average grow time and yield, and the clones/seeds per unit.</p>
<p>Dispensary Details for WooCommerce works with any WordPress theme and simply adds the new Details tab to product pages alongside the various other tabs that WooCommerce displays. The plugin is priced at $149.00, which includes one year of support and updates.</p>
<p>The WordPress product market is just starting to build solutions for the growing marijuana industry, and DeVore predicts that WordPress site builders will soon be in high demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel like the industry is going to become more regulated and also increased banking will allow for companies to focus on the marketing/sales side of the business rather than the business side of the business. With companies like KIND Financial recently putting out a <a href="http://kind.financial/kind-seed-payment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seed-to-sale solution</a> along with a bank in Canada, it&#8217;s just a sign that things are changing for the better.&#8221;</p>
<p>DeVore said changes like these will allow businesses to focus on their websites and WordPress developers will have the opportunity to provide solutions for them, just like they already do for so many other industries. Outside of the U.S. there are already many mail order cannabis services in operation and DeVore said inside the U.S. he has noticed a lot of delivery services that are using WP Dispensary with WooCommerce to allow patients to place orders.</p>
<p>More competition is starting to sprout up for this new niche in the WordPress ecosystem and many of them are working towards providing more comprehensive e-commerce solutions. <a href="https://liftedthemes.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lifted Themes</a> is a shop that sells WordPress plugins and themes for the marijuana industry. The company is working on building products that will sync with major POS or Seed to Sale systems. Similarly, <a href="https://h32b.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">H32B</a> provides a theme along with a suite of WooCommerce plugins for medical marijuana dispensaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-3.12.08-PM-e1509135316697.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://mmjecommerce.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MMJ E-Commerce</a> is another newer company that provides WooCommerce and WordPress plugins and services for dispensaries with a focus on resources for compliance. The site offers plugins for patient registration forms, credit card payments, THC CBD shipping restrictions, and Age Verification forms.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/debraborchardt/2017/01/03/marijuana-sales-totaled-6-7-billion-in-2016/#463a07d75e39" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arcview Market Research</a> published this year showed that North American marijuana sales grew 30% to $6.7 billion and sales are projected to exceed $20 billion by 2021 (assuming a compound annual growth rate of 25%). As of September 2017, <a href="http://www.governing.com/gov-data/state-marijuana-laws-map-medical-recreational.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">29 states and the District of Columbia</a> have laws that legalize marijuana in some form. As prohibition collapses in more states, the marijuana industry is set to expand and this budding niche in the WordPress ecosystem will likely see significant growth.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 21:48:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

One of the annual traditions that&#8217;s part of the event is the <a href="https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2017-survey">WordPress User Survey</a>. The survey is used to gauge who and how people use WordPress. Although the survey says results will be presented at WordCamp US, that hasn&#8217;t been the case the last two years.</p>
<p>Astute readers <a href="https://wptavern.com/take-the-2016-wordpress-user-survey">may remember</a> that results from the 2015 survey were not shared. When asked why, Matt Mullenweg replied, &#8220;Lots of data to go over, but basically more people are using WordPress, app development is growing, lots of people are making their living with WordPress, and other great trends are showing up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ll try to do a blog post about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>That blog post was never published. Additionally, results from last year&#8217;s survey were not shared during the State of the Word or in a blog post.</p>
<p>Thousands of people take the survey providing insight into trends, how people use the software, and demographics. If users voluntarily provide this data to WordPress.org, sharing the results with the public whether it&#8217;s a blog post, separate session, or during the State of the Word, would be a nice way to return the favor.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 20:04:04 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The service is now expanding to help users connect their accounts to more third-party tools that make patron management easier. Patreon <a href="https://blog.patreon.com/patreon-powers-membership-across-the-web/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">launched</a> its new <a href="https://www.patreon.com/apps/featured" rel="noopener" target="_blank">App Directory</a> and <a href="http://patreon.com/portal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Developer Portal</a> today, featuring <a href="https://www.patreon.com/apps/wordpress" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a free WordPress plugin</a> that offers basic membership capabilities.</p>
<p>The plugin uses the Patreon API to tell the WordPress site who is a patron and what pledge level they are at. Patrons can then click on the “Connect with Patreon” button included with the plugin and site owners will have the ability to publish posts that are viewable by patrons only. It also includes an option to provide an ad-free experience for patrons visiting the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/patron-posts.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>
<p>The plugin is free, maintained and supported by Patreon, and released under the Apache License Version 2.0. Users who want more features can purchase a commercial plugin called <a href="https://www.patreon.com/apps/patronpluginpro" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Patron Plugin Pro</a>, which is available in the App Directory from a third party. It offers more granular control over content restriction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make entire site patron only with a single click</li>
<li>Mark an entire post, post type, or parts of content as patron-only with a click</li>
<li>Customizable different types of notifications for Patron only content with Message and buttons</li>
<li>Custom Banner/Notification for non-patrons viewing a patron-only Post</li>
<li>Protect excerpts in listings for patron-only content</li>
</ul>
<p>Usage of the plugin is $30/year, which includes ongoing updates and access to community support. It does not include premium support. Patron Plugin Pro was created and maintained by <a href="https://codebard.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CodeBard</a>, a company that also has a plugin on WordPress.org for <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/patron-button-and-widgets-by-codebard/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">adding Patreon buttons and widgets</a>. For those who want to build their own integrations, Patreon&#8217;s new <a href="https://www.patreon.com/portal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Developer Portal</a> has documentation on its REST API and Webhooks.</p>
<p>Last month Patreon announced that the company had <a href="https://patreonhq.com/new-round-funding-816d5a592477" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raised $60M in new funding</a> and hinted that integrations with other platforms were coming.
